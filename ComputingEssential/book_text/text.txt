Preface
The
20th century brought us the dawn of the digital
information age and unprecedented changes in
information technology. In fact, the rate of
change is clearly increasing. As we begin the 21st
century, computer literacy is undoubtedly becoming a
prerequisite in whatever career you choose.
The goal of Computing Essentials is to provide you
with the basis for understanding the concepts
necessary for success. Computing Essentials also
endeavors to instill an appreciation for the effect of
information technology on people, privacy, ethics, and
our environment and to give you a basis for building
the necessary skill set to succeed in the 21st
century.
Times are changing, technology is changing, and this
text is changing too. As students of today, you are
different from those of yesterday. You put much effort
toward the things that interest you and the things
that are relevant to you. Your efforts directed at
learning application programs and exploring the web
seem, at times, limitless. On the other hand, it is
sometimes difficult to engage in other equally
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
important topics such as personal privacy and
technological advances.
At the beginning of each chapter, we carefully lay out
why and how the chapter’s content is relevant to your
life today and critical to your future. Within each
chapter, we present practical tips related to key
concepts through the demonstration of interesting
applications that are relevant to your lives. Topics
presented focus first on outputs rather than
processes. Then, we discuss the concepts and
processes.
Motivation and relevance are the keys. This text has
several features specifically designed to engage and
demonstrate the relevance of technology in your lives.
These elements are combined with a thorough coverage
of the concepts and sound pedagogical devices.

About the Authors
Courtesy of Timothy O’Leary.
The O’Learys live in the American Southwest and spend
much of their time engaging instructors and students
in conversation about learning. In fact, they have
been talking about learning for over 30 years.
Something in those early conversations convinced them
to write a book, to bring their interest in the

Introduction
“Welcome
to Computing Essentials. I’m Katie, and this is
Alan, we work in information technology. On the following pages,
we’ll be discussing some of the most exciting new developments in
computer technology, including smartphones, tablets, and cloud
computing. Let me begin this chapter by giving you an overview of
the book and showing you some of its special features.”

The purpose of this book is to help you become a highly efficient and
effective computer user. This includes how to use (1) apps and application
software; (2) all types of computer hardware, including mobile devices
like smartphones, tablets, and laptops; and (3) the Internet. Becoming a
highly efficient and effective computer user also requires a full
understanding of the potential impact of technology on privacy and the
environment as well as the role of personal and organizational ethics.
To effectively and efficiently use computers, you need to know the
parts of an information system: people, procedures, software, hardware,
data, and the Internet. You also need to understand the wireless
revolution, the mobile Internet, and the web and to recognize the role of
information technology in your personal and professional life.
Information Systems
When you think of a personal computer, perhaps you think of
just the equipment itself. That is, you think of the screen
or the keyboard. Yet there is more to it than that. The way
to think about a personal computer is as part of an
information system. An information system has several parts:
people, procedures, software, hardware, data, and the
Internet. (See Figure 1-1.)
People: It is easy to overlook people as one of the parts
of an information system. Yet this is what personal
computers are all about—making people, end users like you,
more productive.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Procedures: The rules or guidelines for people to follow
when using software, hardware, and data are procedures.
These procedures are typically documented in manuals
written by computer specialists. Software and hardware
manufacturers provide manuals with their products. These
manuals are provided in either printed or electronic form.
Software: A program consists of the step-by-step
instructions that tell the computer how to do its work.
Software is another name for a program or programs. The
purpose of software is to convert data (unprocessed facts)
into information (processed facts). For example, a payroll
program would instruct the computer to take the number of
hours you worked in a week (data) and multiply it by your
pay rate (data) to determine how much you are paid for the
week (information).
Hardware: The equipment that processes the data to create
information is called hardware. It includes smartphones,
tablets, keyboards, mice, displays, system units, and other
devices. Hardware is controlled by software.
Data: The raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers,
images, and sounds, are called data. Processed data yields
information. Using the previous example of a payroll
program, the data (number of hours worked and pay rate) is
processed (multiplied) to yield information (weekly pay).
Internet: Almost all information systems provide a way to
connect to other people and computers, typically using the
Internet. This connectivity greatly expands the capability
and usefulness of information systems.

People
People are surely the most important part of any information
system. Our lives are touched every day by computers and
information systems. Many times the contact is direct and
obvious, such as when we create documents using a word
processing program or when we connect to the Internet. (See
Figure 1-2.) Other times, the contact is not as obvious.

Community
Every major technology has affected communities—but none in the unique
ways that computers have. We have changed how we interact with our
communities, both in the tools we use to communicate, such as social
media posts, and in the ways we communicate, in emojis and podcasts.
But technology has had a deeper impact on our communities than just the
way we interact. It has forever changed how we find and identify our
communities. Every day, people meet, discuss, and bond with others they
have never met in person. The entire world feels a little smaller, with
our communities extending around the globe.
Throughout this book you will find a variety of features
designed to help you become an efficient and effective end
user. These features include Making IT Work for You, Tips,
Privacy, Community, Ethics, and Careers in IT.
Making IT Work for You. Throughout this book you will find
Making IT Work for You features that present numerous
interesting and practical IT applications. For just a few

Tips. We all can benefit from a few tips or suggestions.
Throughout this book you will find numerous tips to make
your computing safer, more efficient, and more effective.
These tips range from the basics of keeping your computer
system running smoothly to how to protect your 
privacy while surfing the web. For a partial list of
the tips presented in the following chapters, see Figure 1-
4.
Privacy. One of the most critical issues today is how to
protect the privacy of our personal information. Throughout
this book you will find Privacy boxes in the margin that
present information about protecting our privacy.
Community. Computers are changing the way we define and
interact with our communities. In this chapter and the
following ones, you will find Community boxes in the
margins that present ways in which technology affects how
we create and engage with our communities.
Ethics. Most people agree that we should behave ethically.
That is, we should follow a system of moral principles that
direct our everyday lives. However, for any given
circumstance, people often do not agree on the ethics of
the situation. Throughout this book you will find numerous
Ethics boxes posing a variety of different
ethical/unethical situations for your consideration.
Careers in IT. One of the most important decisions of your
life is to decide upon your life’s work or career. Perhaps
you are planning to be a writer, an artist, or an engineer.
Or you might become a professional in information
technology (IT). Each of the following chapters highlights
a specific career in information technology. This feature
provides job descriptions, projected employment demands,
educational requirements, current salary ranges, and

Software
Software, as we mentioned, is another name for programs.
Programs are the instructions that tell the computer how to
process data into the form you want. In most cases, the words
software and programs are interchangeable. There are two
major kinds of software: system software and application
software. You can think of application software as the kind
you use. Think of system software as the kind the computer
uses.
System Software
The user interacts primarily with application software.
System software enables the application software to interact
with the computer hardware. System software is “background”
software that helps the computer manage its own internal
resources.

System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a
collection of programs, including the following:
Operating systems are programs that coordinate computer
resources, provide an interface between users and the
computer, and run applications. Smartphones, tablets, and
many other mobile devices use embedded operating systems,
also known as real-time operating systems (RTOS). Desktop
computers use stand-alone operating systems like Windows
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
10 or macOS. (See Figures 1-5 and 1-6.) Networks use
network operating systems (NOS).
Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing
computer resources. One of the most essential utility
programs that every computer system should have is an
antivirus program. These programs protect your computer
system from viruses or malicious programs that are all too
often deposited onto your computer from the Internet. These
programs can damage software and hardware, as well as
compromise the security and privacy of your personal data.
If your computer does not have an antivirus program
installed on it, you need to get one. To see how you can
install a free antivirus program on your computer, see
Making IT Work for You: Free Antivirus Program on .
Application Software
Application software might be described as end-user
software. Three types of application software are general-
purpose, specialized, and apps.
General-purpose applications are widely used in nearly
all career areas. They are the kinds of programs you have to
know to be considered an efficient and effective end user.
Some of the best known are presented in Figure 1-7.
Specialized applications include thousands of other
programs that are more narrowly focused on specific
disciplines and occupations. Two of the best known are
graphics and web authoring programs.
Mobile apps, also known as mobile applications or simply
apps, are small programs primarily designed for mobile
devices such as smartphones and for tablets. There are over 5
million apps. The most popular mobile apps are for social
networking, playing games, and downloading music and videos.

FREE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM
Have you or someone you know had a slower computing
experience due to a spyware infection? Even worse, perhaps
a malicious piece of software stole crucial, personal
information or caused a total system failure. Most of
these problems can be averted by having an up-to-date
antivirus program running in your computer’s memory at
all times. This exercise shows you how to download and
install a free antivirus program if your computer does not
yet have one. (Please note that the web is continually
changing, and some of the specifics presented here may
have changed.)
Getting Started First, make sure your computer does not have an
antivirus or security suite running. If it does, be sure to completely
uninstall that program, even if the subscription is expired. Now, follow
these steps to install AVG, a popular, free antivirus program:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Visit http://free.avg.com and click the Download button.
You will be asked to click “save” to save the
installation file to your computer.
Run the installation file and follow the prompts.
Select Install Basic to install the antivirus software.
Once the program is installed, it will open automatically.
Using AVG Generally speaking, your antivirus program watches your
system for malware and updates itself automatically. However, you can
always download updates manually, set a schedule for full-system scans,
and change basic settings for various components of the software.
Click Scan now to run a full scan on your computer.
Just to the right of that, click the button with the white
cog to see the scan options, where you can set a schedule
for automated scans.
Click the back arrow to reach the main screen, where you
can click various elements of the program to configure
them. For example, clicking Web will allow you to turn on a
feature that detects cookies that may be used to track your
online activity.

Hardware
Computers are electronic devices that can follow instructions
to accept input, process that input, and produce information.
This book focuses principally on personal computers. However,
it is almost certain that you will come in contact, at least
indirectly, with other types of computers.
Types of Computers
There are four types of computers: supercomputers, mainframe
computers, midrange computers, and personal computers.
Supercomputers are the most powerful type of computer.
These machines are special, high-capacity computers used by
very large organizations. Supercomputers are typically used
to process massive amounts of data. For example, they are
used to analyze and predict worldwide weather patterns.
IBM’s Blue Gene supercomputer is one of the fastest
computers in the world. (See Figure 1-8.)
Mainframe computers occupy specially wired, air-
conditioned rooms. Although not nearly as powerful as
supercomputers, mainframe computers are capable of great
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
processing speeds and data storage. For example, insurance
companies use mainframes to process information about
millions of policyholders.
Midrange computers, also referred to as servers, are
computers with processing capabilities less powerful than a
mainframe computer yet more powerful than a personal
computer. Originally used by medium-size companies or
departments of large companies to support their processing
needs, today midrange computers are most widely used to
support or serve end users for such specific needs as
retrieving data from a database or supplying access to
application software.
Personal computers, also known as PCs, are the 
least powerful, yet the most widely used and
fastest-growing type of computer. There are five types of
personal computers: desktops, laptops, tablets,
smartphones, and wearables. Desktop computers are small
enough to fit on top of or alongside a desk yet are too big
to carry around. (See Figure 1-9.) Laptop computers, also
known as notebook computers, are portable and lightweight
and fit into most briefcases. (See Figure 1-10.) Tablets,
also known as tablet computers, are smaller, lighter, and
generally less powerful than laptops. Like a laptop,
tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a
standard keyboard. (See Figure 1-11.) Instead, tablets
typically use a virtual keyboard that appears on the screen
and is touch-sensitive.
Smartphones are the most widely used personal computer.
Smartphones are cell phones with wireless connections to
the Internet and processing capabilities. (See Figure 1-
12.) Other mobile computers include wearable devices like
Apple’s Watch. (See Figure 1-13.)

Cell Phones
Many people are not aware that their cell phone is a
computer, and this computer has many of the same components
as desktops, laptops, and tablets. At one time, cell phones
had very limited power and were used almost exclusively for
making telephone calls. Now, almost all cell phones are
powerful smartphones capable of connecting to the Internet
and running any number of apps. In fact, nearly every cell
phone purchased today is more powerful than the computers
used to land the first person on the moon.
Today, over 99 percent of Americans under the age of 30
own a cell phone, and over 96 percent of those cell phones
are smartphones. As a result, the two terms are becoming
interchangeable. Reflecting this trend, we will use the terms
cell phone and smartphone interchangeably.
Personal Computer Hardware
Hardware for a personal computer system consists of a variety
of different devices. This physical equipment falls into four
basic categories: system unit, input/output, secondary
storage, and communication. Because we discuss hardware in
detail later in this book, here we will present just a quick
overview of the four basic categories.
System unit: The system unit is a container that houses
most of the electronic components that make up a computer
system. Two important components of the system unit are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
microprocessors and memory. (See Figure 1-14.) The
microprocessor controls and manipulates data to produce
information. Memory is a holding area for data, 
instructions, and information. One type, random-
access memory (RAM), holds the program and data that are
currently being processed. This type of memory is sometimes
referred to as temporary storage because its contents will
typically be lost if the electric power to the computer is
disrupted.
Input/output: Input devices translate data and programs
that humans can understand into a form that the computer
can process. The most common input devices are the keyboard
and the mouse. Output devices translate the processed
information from the computer into a form that humans can
understand. The most common output device is the display,
also known as a monitor.
Secondary storage: Unlike memory, secondary storage holds
data and programs even after electric power to the computer
system has been turned off. The most important kinds of
secondary media are hard disks, solid-state storage, and
optical discs.
Hard disks are typically used to store programs and very
large data files. Using rigid metallic platters and
read/write heads that move across the platters, data and
information are stored using magnetic charges on the
disk’s surface. In contrast, solid-state storage does not
have any moving parts, is more reliable, and requires less
power. It saves data and information electronically similar
to RAM except that it is not volatile. (See Figure 1-15.)
Optical discs use laser technology to store data and
programs. Three types of optical discs are compact discs
(CDs), digital versatile (or video) discs (DVDs), and Blu-
ray discs (BD).
Communication: At one time, it was uncommon for a personal
computer system to communicate with other computer systems.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Now, using communication devices, a personal computer
routinely communicates with other computer systems located
as near as the next office or as far away as halfway around
the world, using the Internet. A modem is a widely used
communication device that modifies audio, video, and other
types of data into a form that can be transmitted across
the Internet.

Data
Data is raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers,
images, and sounds. As we mentioned earlier, processed data
becomes information. When stored electronically in files,
data can be used directly as input for the system unit.
Four common types of files (see Figure 1-16) are
Document files, created by word processors to save
documents such as memos, term papers, and letters.
Worksheet files, created by electronic spreadsheets 
to analyze things like budgets and to predict
sales.
Database files, typically created by database management
programs to contain highly structured and organized data.
For example, an employee database file might contain all
the workers’ names, Social Security numbers, job titles,
and other related pieces of information.
Presentation files, created by presentation software to
save presentation materials. For example, a file might
contain audience handouts, speaker notes, and electronic
slides.

Connectivity and the Mobile
Internet
Connectivity is the capability of your personal computer to
share information with other computers. Central to the
concept of connectivity is the network. A network is a
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
communications system connecting two or more computers. The
largest network in the world is the Internet. It is like a
giant highway that connects you to millions of other people
and organizations located throughout the world. The web
provides a multimedia interface to the numerous resources
available on the Internet.
The Internet has driven the evolution of computers and
their impact on our daily lives. The rate of technological
change is accelerating at an ever faster pace. Along with the
Internet, three things that are driving the impact of
technology on our lives are cloud computing, wireless
communication, and the Internet of Things.
Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift many
computer activities from a user’s computer to computers on
the Internet. Rather than relying solely on their computer,
users can now use the Internet to connect to the cloud and
access more powerful computers, software, and storage.
Wireless communication has changed the way we communicate
with one another. The rapid development and widespread use
of wireless communication devices like tablets, cell
phones, and wearable devices have led many experts to
predict that wireless applications are just the beginning
of the wireless revolution, a revolution that will 
dramatically affect the way we communicate and use
computer technology.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing development
of the Internet that allows everyday objects embedded with
electronic devices to send and receive data over the
Internet. It promises to connect all types of devices, from
computers to cell phones, to watches, to any number of
everyday devices.
Wireless communication, cloud computing, and IoT are
driving the mobile Internet. They promise to continue to
dramatically affect the entire computer industry and how you

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Using and Understanding Information Technology
The purpose of this book is to help you use and understand information
technology. We want to help you become proficient and to provide you with
a foundation of knowledge so that you can understand how technology is
being used today and anticipate how technology will be used in the future.
This will enable you to benefit from six important information technology
developments.
The Internet and the Web
The Internet and the web are considered to be the two most important
technologies for the 21st century. Understanding how to efficiently and
effectively use the Internet to browse, communicate, and locate
information is an essential skill. These issues are presented in Chapter
2, The Internet, the Web, and Electronic Commerce.

Powerful Software
The software that is now available can do an extraordinary number of tasks
and help you in an endless number of ways. You can create professional-
looking documents, analyze massive amounts of data, create dynamic
multimedia web pages, and much more. Today’s employers are expecting the
people they hire to be able to effectively and efficiently use a variety
of different types of software. General-purpose, specialized, and mobile
applications are presented in Chapter 3. System software is presented in
Chapter 4.
Powerful Hardware
Personal computers are now much more powerful than they used to be. Cell
phones, tablets, and communication technologies such as wireless networks
are dramatically changing the ways to connect to other computers,
networks, and the Internet. However, despite the rapid change of specific
equipment, their essential features remain unchanged. To become an
efficient and effective end user, you should focus on these features.
Chapters 5 through 8 explain what you need to know about hardware. For
those considering the purchase of a computer, an appendix—The Computer
Buyer’s Guide—is provided at the end of this book. This guide provides a
very concise comparison of desktops, laptops, tablets, and cell phones.
Privacy, Security, and Ethics
What about people? Experts agree that we as a society must be careful
about the potential of technology to negatively affect our lives.
Specifically, we need to be aware of how technology can affect our
personal privacy and our environment. Also, we need to understand the role
and the importance of organizational and personal ethics. These critical
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
issues are integrated in every chapter of this book as well as extensively
covered in Chapter 9.
Organizations
Almost all organizations rely on the quality and flexibility of their
information systems to stay competitive. As a member or employee of an
organization, you will undoubtedly be involved in these information
systems. In order to use, develop, modify, and maintain these systems, you
need to understand the basic concepts of information systems and know how
to safely, efficiently, and effectively use computers. These concepts are
covered throughout this book.
Changing Times
Are the times changing any faster now than they ever have? Almost everyone

The way to think about a personal computer is to realize
that it is one part of an information system. There are
several parts of an information system:
People are an essential part of the system. The
purpose of information systems is to make people, or
end users like you, more productive.
Procedures are rules or guidelines to follow when
using software, hardware, and data. They are typically
documented in manuals written by computer
professionals.
Software (programs) provides step-by-step instructions
to control the computer to convert data into
information.
Hardware consists of the physical equipment. It is
controlled by software and processes data to create
information.
Data consists of unprocessed facts, including text,
numbers, images, and sound. Information is data that
has been processed by the computer.
The Internet allows computers to connect and share
information.

and the web and to recognize the role of technology in
your professional and personal life.
SOFTWARE
Microsoft Corporation
Software, or programs, consists of system and
application software.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
System Software
System software enables application software to interact
with computer hardware.
Operating systems coordinate resources, provide an
interface, and run applications. Three types are
embedded (real-time, RTOS), stand-alone, and network
(NOS).
Utilities perform specific tasks to manage computer
resources.
Application Software
Application software includes general-purpose,
specialized, and mobile applications.
General purpose—widely used in nearly all career
areas; programs include browsers, word processors,
spreadsheets, database management systems, and
presentation software.
Specialized—focus more on specific disciplines and
occupations; programs include graphics and web
authoring.
Apps (mobile apps, mobile applications)—designed for
mobile devices; most popular are for text messaging,
Internet browsing, and connecting to social networks.
HARDWARE

Hardware consists of electronic devices that can follow
instructions to accept input, process the input, and
produce information.
Types of Computers
Supercomputer, mainframe, midrange (server), and
personal computers (PCs) are four types of computers. A
personal computer can be a desktop, laptop (notebook
computer), tablet, smartphone, or a wearable.
Cell Phones
Today, almost all cell phones are smartphones; cell phone
and smartphone are becoming interchangeable terms.
Personal Computer Hardware
There are four basic categories of hardware devices:
System unit contains electronic circuitry, including
microprocessors and memory. Random-access memory
(RAM) holds the program and data currently being
processed.
Input/output devices are translators between humans
and computers. Input devices include the keyboard and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
mouse. The most common output device is the computer
display (monitor).
Secondary storage holds data and programs. Typical
media include hard disks, solid-state storage, and
optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray).
Communication devices allow personal computers to
communicate with other computer systems. Modems modify
audio, video, and other types of data for transmission
across the Internet.

DATA
Data is the raw unprocessed facts about something. Common
file types include
Document files created by word processors.

CONNECTIVITY AND THE MOBILE INTERNET
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Connectivity describes the ability of end users to use
resources well beyond their desktops. Central to the
concept of connectivity is the network or communication
system connecting two or more computers. The Internet is
the world’s largest computer network. The web provides
a multimedia interface to resources available on the
Internet.
Along with the Internet, three other things are
driving the impact of technology:
Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift
many computer activities from a user’s computer to
computers on the Internet.
Wireless revolution has changed the way we communicate
and use computer technology. Wireless devices include
tablets, cell phones, and watches.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing
development of the Internet that allows everyday
objects embedded with electronic devices to send and
receive data over the Internet.

When you use a cell phone to text a friend, watch a video, or make a
purchase, you are using the Internet. But what does it mean to “use the
Internet”? Internet devices, like cell phones, are so common it is easy
to overlook the incredible achievements that make the Internet possible. A
closer look at how the Internet works will give you a new appreciation for
this technical marvel and prepare you to use cell phones and other
Internet devices to their full potential.
The Internet is an interconnected mesh of computers and data lines that
connects millions of people and organizations. It is the foundation of the
digital revolution and allows people around the world to share words,
images, and any digital file almost instantaneously. The web provides an
easy-to-use interface to Internet resources. It has become an everyday
tool for all of us to use.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of
the resources available on the Internet and the web. Additionally, you
need to know how to access these resources, to effectively communicate
electronically, to efficiently locate information, to understand
electronic commerce, and to use web utilities.
The Internet and the Web
The Internet was launched in 1969 when the United States
funded a project that developed a national computer network
called Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET)
and has grown to become the largest network in the world. The
Internet is an immense network that connects together smaller
networks all over the globe. The web, also known as the World
Wide Web or WWW, was introduced in 1991. Prior to the web,
the Internet was all text—no graphics, animations, sound, or
video. The web made it possible to include these elements. It
provided a multimedia interface to resources available on the
Internet.
Today, the web is a collection of machines and people
sharing amazing content, but not long ago it was a far
simpler experience. The web has matured through four
generations, commonly called Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. Each
generation is defined by a new technology that changes the
relationship between content creator and audience.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Web 1.0 is defined by the use of search engines that
connect everyone to web pages of interest. A search engine
makes it possible for users to search the web for web pages
of interest. These web pages had few creators because they
were difficult to create and required a background in
computers and programming. The web pages had very large
audiences because they were designed to be read by anyone
who searched for them.
Web 2.0 is defined by the use of social media that connect
friends and family to social media posts about each
others’ lives. Social media sites make it possible for
people to share videos, posts, and pictures with each
other. This content is created by many people because
creating social media posts does not require special
technical knowledge. Social media posts have smaller
audiences because they are created to only be of interest
to the friends and family of the user who posts the
content.
Web 3.0 is defined by the innovation of the semantic web.
The semantic web allows programs to identify relationships
between data. For example, a program like Amazon’s Alexa
and Google Assistant can inform a user that a flight they
are planning to take has been delayed (see Figure 2-1).
This is accomplished by identifying the relationship
between a flight scheduled on your calendar and flight
delay information available on the Internet. The content
creator is now a computer program, and the content audience
is a single person—the user.
Web 4.0, called the mobile web, is defined by the 
use of mobile tools that provide new sources of
information for programs to provide users with information.
This is an extension of Web 3.0, where programs draw
relationships among data to assist individuals, but now the
information available to these programs includes the
information gathered by mobile devices. For example, your
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
cell phone can provide your current location, or your
smartwatch can report your heart rate. A program like
Apple’s Siri can use your current location, the location
of your next calendar event, and local traffic reports on
the Internet to alert you to leave early for an appointment
because of a traffic jam between your current location and
your next event.
Figure 2-1 Web 3.0 application
Google INC.
Just because a new generation of technology comes along
doesn’t mean that older generations are done evolving. We
continue to see innovations in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0
technologies even as Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies are
still being incorporated into our lives. Web 5.0 is on the
horizon—called the emotional web, this generation may
include programs that anticipate our needs based on our mood
and behaviors. However, this future is not yet realized, and
the specifics of Web 5.0 are still to be determined.
It is easy to get the Internet and the web confused, but
they are not the same thing. The Internet is the physical
network. It is made up of wires, cables, satellites, and
rules for exchanging information between computers connected
to the network. Being connected to this network is often
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
described as being online. The Internet connects millions of
computers and resources throughout the world. The web is a
multimedia interface to the resources available on the
Internet. Every day over a billion users from nearly every
country in the world use the Internet and the web. What are
they doing? The most common uses are the following:
Communicating is by far the most popular Internet activity.
Every time someone receives a text, sends an e-mail, or
shares photos or videos online, they are communicating on
the Internet.
Shopping is one of the fastest-growing Internet
applications. From everyday items, like buying groceries,
to special purchases, like buying a prom dress, the
Internet provides a way to get the latest trends and the
cheapest deals.
Searching for information has never been more convenient.
You can access some of the world’s largest libraries
directly from your home computer.
Education or e-learning is another rapidly evolving web
application. You can take driving school classes on your
cell phone or earn college credit from your laptop. There
are courses for every price range and interest.
Online entertainment options are nearly endless. You can
find the latest movies and news, listen your favorite
songs, and play video games with friends around the world.

ethics
Twitter and other social media organizations ban users who post hateful
or violent content. Some people feel that Twitter has an ethical
responsibility to monitor and remove offensive or inaccurate content.
Others say that censorship is a violation of an individual’s right to

Online Video—The Internet offers dozens of ways to view movies and
TV on your Internet-connected devices. Here are four things to
consider:
Is the service free or does it require a monthly subscription? Many
big-name services charge a monthly fee, but there are also plenty of
services that are free with ads.
Does the service include ads? Some services include ads even if you
pay a monthly subscription fee.
What movies and shows are available? Each service has its own
collection of available videos. Before subscribing, make sure you
like what they have to offer.
Will the service work on your devices? Not every service works on
every device. Make sure your devices are supported.
Paid subscription services, like Netflix, offer popular film and TV
shows, as well as original content.
HBO
Some services are best known for their libraries of movies, full seasons
of older TV shows, and original movies and shows exclusively available on
their service. Services such as these include
Amazon Prime (amazon.com/prime).
Netflix (netflix.com).
HBO Max (hbomax.com).
Some services offer a more TV-like experience, offering live TV channel
content, including local news, national news, and sports coverage. Some
of the most popular services that include live TV channels are
Hulu (hulu.com).
YouTube TV (tv.youtube.com).

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Online Music—You can access large music libraries online, with
everything from contemporary hits to classical music. The things to
consider when selecting an online music source are similar to choosing
an online movie and TV service:
Is the service free, or does it require a monthly fee?
Does the service include ads?
What musicians and albums are available on the service?
Does the service work with your devices?

Popular online music services include
Spotify (spotify.com).
YouTube music (music.youtube.com).
Tidal (tidal.com).
Online Books—Digital books allow you to download and read books on
your cell phone, tablet, or laptop. Two of the most popular digital
book sellers are Amazon’s Kindle Store (amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks) and
Barnes and Noble’s Nook Store (barnesandnoble.com).
Digital books allow you to read several books at a time on different
digital devices without having to carry around tons of books.
Aspiro AB
Before purchasing a book, consider checking out your local library’s
digital book collection. Most libraries offer digital books, magazines,
and audio books you can borrow without ever having to set foot in the
library. There are also services that give you access to reading material
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
for a monthly fee. Scribd (scribd.com) offers access to its collection of
books, magazines, and audiobooks for a monthly fee, and audible
(audible.com) specializes in audiobooks.
Popular social media site Instagram updates your Instagram account with
new postings from users around the world.
Instagram Inc.
Social Media—Social media websites offer a way to connect and
interact with others about news, movies, and everyday life. Thoughts
and ideas are posted instantly with sites like Twitter, a popular
platform for sharing short messages, videos, and photos. You can
follow other Twitter users to get automatic updates on the posts
they make, and others can follow you to keep up to date on your
posts.Things
to consider when choosing a social media app:
Does the social media app work on your devices? Not all social
media apps are available on all devices. For example, many social
media apps only work on cell phones.
Do your friends and family already belong to a social media site?
While social media is a great way to meet new people, it is also a
great way to keep up with friends and family. If you already know
people who use a social media app, they could be a good way to try
out social media.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
What types of interactions does the social media app 
support? Different social media sites support different
types of interactions. For example, TikTok specializes in short
videos, and Instagram encourages sharing photos. Choose an app
that caters to what you are interested in sharing.
News feed services, like feedly.com, allow you to search for news sources
by publisher or topic, creating a more “newspaper”-like reading
experience.
Apple Inc.
Popular social media sites include
Twitter (twitter.com).
Facebook (facebook.com).
Instagram (instagram.com).
TikTok (tiktok.com).
News Feeds—Social media services such as Facebook or Twitter are a
good way to share and explore news, but they don’t offer an
experience similar to a newspaper. For a more traditional view of the
day’s events, consider a news feed service. A news feed application
takes articles from news organizations, collects them according to
your interest, and presents them like a newspaper—grouped by topic
and in chronological order
Popular news feed services include
Feedly (feedly.com).
Google News (news.google.com).

lectures, topical discussions, and interviews, or they can be fiction,
such as science fiction, drama, or suspense stories. You can use a
podcast app to subscribe to a podcast and share podcasts with friends,

Spotify (spotify.com).

Internet Access
Your computer is a very powerful tool. However, it needs to
be connected to the Internet to truly unleash its power. Once
on the Internet, your computer becomes an extension of what
seems like a giant computer—a computer that branches all
over the world. When provided with a connection to the
Internet, you can use a browser program to search the web.
Providers
The most common way to access the Internet is through an
Internet service provider (ISP). The providers are already
connected to the Internet and provide a path or connection
for individuals to access the Internet.
The most widely used commercial Internet service providers
use telephone lines, cable, and/or wireless connections. Some
of the best-known providers in the United States are AT&T,
Comcast, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon.

As we will discuss in Chapter 8, users connect to ISPs
using one of a variety of connection technologies including
digital subscriber line (DSL), cable, and wireless modems.
tips
Are you getting the most out of your web browser? Here are a
few suggestions to make you faster and more efficient.
1
Bookmarks/Favorites Bar: Most browsers have a bookmarks or
favorites bar just below the address bar. Add your top 5 or 10
most-often-visited websites here. The next time you want to visit
one of these sites, select it from the bookmarks/favorites list
rather than entering the site’s URL.
2
Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts are often faster than using a mouse.
Use the following: F5 (refresh); Alt + left arrow (back); Ctrl + T
(new tab); Ctrl + W (close tab); Ctrl + Enter (adds “www” and
“.com” to any domain name you type in the address bar).
3
Extensions/Add-Ons: Many browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox,
allow users to install small, third-party programs that extend, or
add to, the capabilities of the browser. These programs can
perform a variety of tasks, from providing easy access to your
cloud services to making it easier to capture information on a web
page.
4
Configure Settings: All browsers have a settings or options page
that provides ways to secure and customize your Internet browsing.
For example, you can deny websites from automatically opening up
another browser window, called pop-ups (these annoying windows
often contain advertisements). You can also set up your browser to
always open the same websites on starting up your browser.
Browsers
Today it is common to access the Internet from a variety of
devices like cell phones, tablets, and laptops. These devices
use programs called browsers to provide access to web
resources. These programs connect you to remote computers;
open and transfer files; display text, images, and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
multimedia; and provide in one tool an uncomplicated
interface to the Internet and web documents. Four well-known
browsers are Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and
Mozilla Firefox. (See Figure 2-2.)
Figure 2-2 Browser

Browsers differ not only by designer, but also by what
device they work on. For example, Chrome is a web browser
designed by Google that has a mobile version for 
cell phones and tablets and a desktop version for
laptops and desktops. Mobile browsers are designed for the
smaller touchscreens of mobile devices. They typically have
larger buttons to select options and provide multitouch
support for actions such as “pinch” or “stretch” to zoom
in on web content. (See Figure 2-3.) Desktop browsers are
designed for laptop and desktop computers, with smaller
buttons and more on-screen options designed to take advantage
of larger monitors and the precision of mouse input.

For browsers to connect to resources, the location or
address of the resources must be specified. These addresses
are called uniform resource locators (URLs). All URLs have
at least two basic parts.
The first part presents the protocol used to connect to the
resource. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, protocols are
rules for exchanging data between computers. The protocol
https is used for web traffic and is one of the most widely
used Internet protocols.
The second part presents the domain name. It indicates the
specific address where the resource is located. In Figure
2-4 the domain is identified as www.mtv.com. The last part
of the domain name following the dot (.) is the top-level
domain (TLD). Also known as the web suffix, it typically
identifies the type of organization. For example, .com
indicates a commercial site. (See Figure 2-5.)

Once the browser has connected to the website, a document
file is sent back to your computer. This document typically
contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a markup language
for displaying web pages. The browser interprets the HTML
formatting instructions and displays the document as a web
page. For example, when your browser first connects to the
Internet, it opens up to a web page specified in the browser
settings. Web pages present information about the site along
with references and hyperlinks or links that connect to other
documents containing related information—text files, graphic
images, audio, and video clips.
Various technologies are used to provide highly
interactive and animated websites. These technologies include
the following:
JavaScript is a language often used within HTML documents
to trigger interactive features, such as opening new
browser windows and checking information entered in online
forms. The Microsoft search engine Bing.com uses JavaScript
to make its website more interactive and to assist its
users by auto-filling search requests as they type content
into the search box.
PHP, like JavaScript, is a language often used within HTML
documents to improve a website’s interactivity. Unlike
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
JavaScript, which typically executes on the user’s
computer, PHP executes on the website’s computer.
Cascading style sheets (CSS) are separate files referenced
by, or lines inserted into, an HTML document that control
the appearance of a web page. CSS help ensure that related
web pages have a consistent presentation or look. Netflix
uses CSS to visually connect all its web pages.

Web Utilities
Utilities are programs that make computing easier. Web
utilities are specialized utility programs that make the
Internet and the web easier and safer to use. Some of these
utilities are browser-related programs that either become
part of your browser or are executed from your browser, while
others work as separate stand-alone applications. Common uses
for web utilities include filtering content and transferring
files.
Filters
Filters block access to selected sites. The Internet is an
interesting and multifaceted arena. But not all aspects of
the Internet are appropriate for all audiences. Parents, in
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
particular, are concerned about children roaming unrestricted
across the Internet. Filter programs allow parents as well as
organizations to block out selected sites and set time
limits. (See Figure 2-6.) Additionally, these programs can
monitor use and generate reports detailing the total time
spent on the Internet and the time spent at individual
websites. For a list of some of the best-known filters, see
Figure 2-7.

File Transfer Utilities
Using file transfer utility software, you can copy files to
your computer from specially configured servers. This is
called downloading. You also can use file transfer utility
software to copy files from your computer to another computer
on the Internet. This is called uploading. Three popular
types of file transfer are web-based, BitTorrent, and FTP.
Web-based file transfer services make use of a web browser
to upload and download files. This eliminates the need for
any custom software to be installed. Popular services
include Microsoft’s onedrive (onedrive.com) and Google’s
Google drive (drive.google.com).
BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many different
computers for more efficient downloads, unlike other
transfer technologies whereby a file is copied from one
computer on the Internet to another. A single file might be
located on dozens of individual computers. When you
download the file, each computer sends you a tiny piece of
the larger file, making BitTorrent well suited for 
transferring very large files. Unfortunately,
BitTorrent technology often has been used for distributing
unauthorized copies of copyrighted music and video.
File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer
protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files to and
from your computer across the Internet and are frequently
used for uploading changes to a website hosted by an
Internet service provider. FTP has been used for decades
and still remains one of the most popular methods of file
transfer.
Internet Security Suites

An Internet security suite is a collection of utility
programs designed to maintain your security and privacy while
you are on the web. These programs control spam, protect
against computer viruses, provide filters, and much more. You
could buy each program separately; however, the cost of the
suite is typically much less. Two of the best-known Internet
security suites are Symantec Norton Internet Security and
Bitdefender Internet Security. These companies also offer
apps for mobile devices: Bitdefender Mobile Security and
Norton Mobile Security. (See Figure 2-8.)

Communication
As previously mentioned, communication is the most popular
Internet activity, and its impact cannot be overestimated. At
a personal level, friends and family can stay in contact with
one another even when separated by thousands of miles. At a
business level, electronic communication has become a
standard way to stay in touch with suppliers, employees, and
customers. Some popular types of Internet communication are
social networking, blogs, microblogs, podcasts, wikis, e-
mail, and messaging.
community
Every community has etiquette rules. On the Internet, these rules are
called “netiquette,” a combination of Internet and etiquette. When
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
you enter a new community—online or in real life—it can be difficult
to learn the etiquette rules. Fortunately, many social media sites have
guidelines for new users to help them navigate the netiquette of social
media. For example, did you know it was bad manners to type in all
capital letters? It can make readers feel that you are screaming at
them! Before communicating online, make sure you understand the
netiquette of that community.
Social Networking
Social networking is one of the fastest-growing and most
significant Web 2.0 applications. Social networking sites
focus on connecting people and organizations that share a
common interest or activity. These sites typically provide a
wide array of tools that facilitate meeting, communicating,
and sharing. There are hundreds of social networking sites,
but they share some common features:
Profiles or pages allow you to share information about
yourself or your business. Individuals create profiles
while businesses create pages. Profiles and pages often
include a photo that will be displayed along with the
member name when they submit a post or send a message.
Individuals typically use a photo of their face, while
businesses often use a business logo. Other details that
your profile or page might include are contact information
and a short biography describing yourself or your business.
Groups and friends are the other members on social media
that you will communicate with. Friends are individuals you
communicate with, while groups are communities of other
members that share information and discuss specific topics.
Groups often organize around a topic, event, or idea.
News feed is the first page you see after logging into a
social networking site. It typically consists of a
collection of recent posts from friends, trending topics on
the site, people’s responses to your posts, and
advertisements.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Share settings on your social media account determine who
can see your posts. The most common options include sharing
with everyone, just your friends, or just a subset of your
friends.

privacy
Have you ever seen one of those funny or not-so-funny embarrassing
personal videos on the Internet? Unless you are careful, you could be
starring in one of those videos. Without privacy settings, images and
videos posted to these sites can be viewed and potentially reposted for
all to see. If a social networking friend were to post an embarrassing
video, would all your friends be able to see it? What about parents,
teachers, or potential employers?

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
A social network often has an overall focus. For example,
LinkedIn is a popular business-oriented social networking
site. The profiles on LinkedIn share professional
information, like resumes and job successes, and the
corporate pages concentrate on sharing their corporate
culture and promoting job openings. By contrast, the largest
social networking site, Facebook, originally had a focus of
connecting friends and family, but it has expanded to include
news sites, entertainment sites, and a powerful way for
businesses and organizations to connect with their audience.
While Facebook is the largest social network, there are
many social networking sites, each with its own unique
features and interactions. For example, TikTok is a social
networking site that concentrates on sharing short videos,
and Instagram puts an emphasis on sharing photos. For a list
of some of the most popular sites, see Figure 2-11.

communication alternatives offer greater flexibility and

security; however, they are often more complex to set up and
maintain.
Many individuals create personal websites, called blogs,
to keep in touch with friends and family. Blog postings are
time-stamped and arranged with the newest item first. Often,
readers of these sites are allowed to comment. Some blogs are
like online diaries with personal information; others focus
on information about a hobby or theme, such as knitting,
electronic devices, or good books. Although most are written
by individual bloggers, there are also group blogs with
multiple contributors. Some businesses and newspapers also
have started blogging as a quick publishing method. Several
sites provide tools to create blogs. Two of the most widely
used are Blogger and WordPress.
Much like a blog, a microblog allows an individual or
company to share posts with an audience. However, microblogs
are designed to be used with mobile devices and limit the
size of posts. For example, Twitter, one of the most popular
microblogging sites, limits posts, also known as tweets, to
280 characters. (See Figure 2-12.) Instagram, another popular
microblogging site, is designed to share images and videos
posts, with little to no written content.

Microblogging has become a significant media tool, used by
politicians and celebrities to share moment-to-moment
thoughts with their audience. For example, Taylor Swift has
over 83 million followers on Twitter.
Podcasts are audio programs delivered over the Internet.
Typically, a podcast is one audio program in a series of
related podcasts. For example, The Science of Happiness
podcast offers a series of episodes presenting tips for a
happier life. (See Figure 2-13.) Podcasts vary 
widely, from daily news to arts and comedy shows.

A wiki is a website specially designed to allow visitors
to use their browser to add, edit, or delete the site’s
content. “Wiki” comes from the Hawaiian word for fast,
which describes the simplicity of editing and publishing
through wiki software. Wikis support collaborative writing in
which there isn’t a single expert author, but rather a
community of interested people that builds knowledge over
time. Perhaps the most famous example is Wikipedia, an online
encyclopedia, written and edited by anyone who wants to
contribute, that has millions of entries in over 20
languages.
Creating blogs and wikis are examples of web authoring. We
will discuss web authoring software in detail in Chapter 3.

Our real life and our digital lives compete for our attention—
sometimes with deadly results. In 2020, over 1.6 million car collisions
were attributed to texting while driving. Engineers, programmers, and
government officials are working hard to find innovative solutions to
reduce these preventable tragedies. Does your cell phone have a
“driving mode” or apps to help keep drivers focused on the road? What
are the laws in your area regarding texting and driving?
Messaging
Electronic messaging is a popular way to communicate quickly
and efficiently with friends, family, and co-workers. This
form of communication is particularly common on cell phones,
where messages are short and informal, and instantaneous
responses are the standard. The two most widely used forms of
electronic messaging are text and instant messaging.
Text messaging, also known as texting or SMS (short
message service), is the process of sending a short
electronic message, typically fewer than 160 characters,
using a wireless network to another person, who views the
message on a mobile device such as a cell phone. Today,
billions of people send text messages every day. It has
become one of the most widely used ways to send very short
messages from one individual to another. Text messaging was
originally limited to characters, but you can now send
images, video, and sound using a variation of SMS known as
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
MMS (multimedia messaging service). Although popular and
convenient, there are downsides to using this technology in
the wrong context. A great deal of attention has been
directed toward texting while driving. A study by Car and
Driver concluded that texting while driving had a greater
negative impact on driver safety than being drunk. Several
states have passed laws prohibiting texting while driving.
Instant messaging (IM) allows two or more people to
contact each other via direct, live communication. (See
Figure 2-15.) To use instant messaging, you 
register with an instant messaging service and then
specify a list of friends. Whenever you connect to the
Internet, your IM service is notified. It then notifies
your friends who are available to chat and notifies your
friends who are online that you are available. You can then
send messages directly back and forth. Most instant
messaging programs also include videoconferencing features,
file sharing, and remote assistance. Many businesses
routinely use these instant messaging features. Three of
the most popular instant messaging services are Facebook
Messenger, WhatsApp, and Google Meet.

E-mail
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Unlike electronic messaging, e-mail or electronic mail is
used to communicate longer and more formal text. E-mail
exchanges tend to take longer to write and are more carefully
crafted than text message exchanges, which make them ideal
for business communications and newsletters. A typical e-mail
message has four basic elements: header, message, signature,
and attachment. (See Figure 2-16.) The header appears first
and typically includes the following information:
Addresses: E-mail messages typically display the addresses
of the intended recipient of the e-mail, anyone else who is
to receive a copy of the e-mail, and the sender of the e-
mail. The e-mail message in Figure 2-16 is to
dcoats@usc.edu, copied to aboyd@sdu.edu, and sent from
cwillis@nyu.edu. E-mail addresses have two basic parts.
(See Figure 2-17.) The first part is the user’s name and
the second part is the domain name, which includes the top-
level domain. In our example e-mail, dcoats is the
recipient’s user name. The server providing e-mail service
for the recipient is usc.edu. The top-level domain
indicates that the provider is an educational institution.
Subject: A one-line description, used to present the topic
of the message. Subject lines typically are displayed when
a person checks his or her mailbox.

e-mail programs allow you to include files such as documents
and images as attachments. If a message has an attachment,
the file name typically appears at the end of the e-mail.
(See Figure 2-16.)
There are two basic types of e-mail systems: client-based
and web-based.
Client-based e-mail systems require a special program
known as an e-mail client to be installed on your computer.
Before you can begin e-mailing, you need to run the e-mail
client from your computer, which communicates with the e-
mail service provider. Two of the most widely used e-mail
clients are Apple’s Mail and Microsoft’s Outlook.
Web-based e-mail systems do not require an e-mail program
to be installed on your computer. Once your computer’s
browser connects to an e-mail service provider, a special
program called a webmail client is run on the e-mail
provider’s computer and then you can begin e-mailing. This
is known as webmail. Most Internet service providers offer
webmail services. Three free webmail service providers are
Google’s Gmail, Microsoft’s Outlook, and Yahoo!’s Yahoo!
Mail.
For individual use, webmail is more widely used because it
frees the user from installing and maintaining an e-mail
client on every computer used to access e-mail. With webmail,
you can access your e-mail from any computer anywhere that
has Internet access.
E-mail can be a valuable asset in your personal and
professional life. However, like many other valuable
technologies, there are drawbacks too. Americans receive
billions of unwanted and unsolicited e-mails every year. This
unwelcome mail is called spam. Although spam is indeed a
distraction and nuisance, it also can be dangerous. For
example, computer viruses or destructive programs are often

attached to unsolicited e-mail. Computer viruses will be
discussed in Chapter 4.
tips
Are you tired of sorting through an inbox full of spam? Here
are a few spam-reducing suggestions:
1
Keep a low profile. Many spammers collect e-mail addresses from
personal web pages, social networking sites, and message boards.
Be cautious when posting your address.
2
Use caution when giving out your address. Many companies
collect and sell e-mail addresses to spammers. Be sure to read the
privacy policy of a site before providing your address.
3
Don’t ever respond to spam. Many are a trick to validate active
e-mail addresses. These addresses are worth more to spammers, who
then sell the addresses to other spammers.
4
Use antispam and filter options. Most e-mail programs and web-
based e-mail services have antispam and filter options that can be
configured. Use them.
In an attempt to control spam, antispam laws have been
added to our legal system. For example, CAN-SPAM requires
that every marketing-related e-mail provide an opt-out
option. When the option is selected, the recipient’s e-mail
address is to be removed from future mailing lists. Failure
to do so results in heavy fines. This approach, however, has
had minimal impact since over 80 percent of all spam
originates from servers outside the United States. A more
effective approach to controlling spam has been the
development and use of spam blockers, also known as spam
filters. Most e-mail programs provide spam-blocking
capabilities.

Search Tools
The web can be an incredible resource, providing information
on nearly any topic imaginable. Are you interested in music?
Writing a paper on the environment? Looking for a movie
review? Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information
sources related to these questions, and much, much more, are
available on the web.
With over 20 billion pages and more being added daily, the
web is a massive collection of interrelated pages. With so
much available information, locating the precise information
you need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of
organizations called search services operate websites that
can help you locate the information you need.
Search services maintain huge databases relating to
information provided on the web and the Internet. The
information stored in these databases includes addresses,
content descriptions or classifications, and keywords
appearing on web pages and other Internet informational
resources. Special automated programs called spiders
continually look for new information and update the search
services’ databases. Additionally, search services provide
special programs called search engines that you can use to
locate specific information on the web.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs that assist you in
locating information on the web and the Internet. To find
information, you go to a search service’s website and use
its search engine. See Figure 2-18 for a list of commonly
used search engines.
Search Site
Service
Bing www.bing.com
Duckduckgo www.duckduckgo.com
Google www.google.com
Yahoo! www.yahoo.com
Figure 2-18 Search engines
To use a search website, you enter a keyword or phrase
reflecting the information you want. The search engine
compares your entry against its database and returns the
search result, or a list of sites on that topic. Each search
result includes a link to the referenced web page (or other
resource), along with a brief discussion of the information
contained at that location. Many searches result in a large
number of search results. For example, if you were to enter
the keyword music, you would get billions of sites on that
topic. Search engines order the search results according to
those sites that most likely contain the information
requested and present the list to you in that order, usually
in groups of 10.
Because each search service maintains its own database,
the search results returned by one search engine will not
necessarily be the same results returned by another search
engine. Therefore, when researching a topic, it is best to
use more than one search engine.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Content Evaluation
Search engines are excellent tools to locate information on
the web. Be careful, however, how you use the information you
find. Unlike most published material found in newspapers,
journals, and textbooks, not all the information you find on
the web has been subjected to strict guidelines to ensure
accuracy. In fact, anyone can publish content on the web.
Many sites allow anyone to post new material, sometimes
anonymously and without evaluation. Some sites promote fake
news or information that is inaccurate or biased. This can
include manipulated videos known as deep fakes, where an
individual’s appearance or message is changed. Many of these
sites are designed to look like legitimate news sites.
Before you believe a website’s claims or share that site
with friends and family, consider the following:
Authority. Is the author an expert in the subject area? Is
the site an official site for the information presented, or
is the site an individual’s personal website?
Accuracy. Read beyond the headlines and consult other
reputable sources on any surprising claims to separate the
real news from the fake. Headlines can be 
misleading and fake news articles often make their
statements seem accurate by referencing other fake news
articles.
Objectivity. Is the information factually reported, or does
the author have a bias? Does the author appear to have a
personal agenda aimed at convincing or changing the
reader’s opinion?
Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site
specify the date when the site was updated? Are the site’s
links operational? If not, the site is most likely not
being actively maintained.

What are search services, spiders, and search engines?
What is fake news? Deep fakes?
What are the four considerations for evaluating website content?
community
Social media communities share news through likes, comments, and
reposting articles. Unfortunately, many of these articles may be
misleading or outright lies. When a user shares a news article, are
they responsible for verifying that the article is true, or does that
responsibility fall to the reader? Even if the articles are lies,
social networking sites benefit from the clicks and views of these
articles. Do social media companies have a responsibility to identify
or eliminate fake news?
Electronic Commerce
Electronic commerce, also known as e-commerce, is the buying
and selling of goods over the Internet. Electronic commerce
is fast-growing and widely used in part because it provides
incentives for both buyers and sellers. From the buyer’s
perspective, goods and services can be purchased at any time
of day or night from any location that has an Internet
connection. From the seller’s perspective, the costs
associated with owning and operating a retail outlet can be
eliminated. Another advantage is reduced inventory.
Traditional stores maintain an inventory of goods in their
stores and periodically replenish this inventory from
warehouses. With e-commerce, there is no in-store inventory
and products are shipped directly from warehouses.
While there are numerous advantages to e-commerce, there
are disadvantages as well. Some of these disadvantages
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
include the inability to provide immediate delivery of goods,
the inability to “try on” prospective purchases, and
questions relating to the security of online payments.
Although these issues are being addressed, very few observers
suggest that e-commerce will replace brick-and-mortar
businesses entirely. It is clear that both will coexist and
that e-commerce will continue to grow.
Just like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce
involves two parties: businesses and consumers. There are
three basic types of electronic commerce:
Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce involves the sale of a
product or service to the general public or end users. It
is the fastest-growing type of e-commerce. Whether large or
small, nearly every existing corporation in the United
States provides some type of B2C support as another means
to connect to customers. Because extensive investments are
not required to create traditional retail outlets and to
maintain large marketing and sales staffs, e-commerce
allows start-up companies to compete with larger
established firms. The three most widely used B2C
applications are for online banking, financial trading, and
shopping. Amazon.com is one of the most widely used B2C
sites.
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce involves individuals
selling to individuals. C2C often takes the form of an
electronic version of the classified ads or an auction. Web
auctions are similar to traditional auctions except that
buyers and sellers seldom, if ever, meet face to face.
Sellers post descriptions of products at a website, and
buyers submit bids electronically. Like traditional
auctions, sometimes the bidding becomes highly competitive
and enthusiastic. One of the most widely used auction sites
is eBay.com. For a list of some of the most popular C2C
sites, see Figure 2-19.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Business-to-business (B2B) commerce involves the 
sale of a product or service from one business to
another. This is typically a manufacturer–supplier
relationship. For example, a furniture manufacturer
requires raw materials such as wood, paint, and varnish.

Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are (1) developing
fast, secure, and reliable payment methods for purchased
goods and (2) providing convenient ways to submit required
information such as mailing addresses and credit card
information.
The two basic payment options are by credit card and by
digital cash:
Credit card purchases are faster and more convenient than
check purchases. Credit card fraud, however, is a major
concern for both buyers and sellers. We will discuss this
and other privacy and security issues related to the
Internet in Chapter 9.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Digital currency is the Internet’s equivalent to
traditional cash. Buyers purchase digital currency from a
third party (a bank that specializes in electronic
currency) and use it to purchase goods. (See Figure 2-20.)
Most digital currency is a digital version of traditional
currency, such that a digital U.S. dollar has the same
purchasing power as a traditional U.S. dollar. For example,
Facebook’s digital cash, Diem, is tied to the U.S. dollar.
For a list of digital currency providers, see Figure 2-21.
Some digital currencies, like bitcoin, have no traditional
cash equivalent, and their transactions do not involve
third-party banks. Such a currency is called a
cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies use public ledgers, known
as blockchains, to record all transactions of the
cryptocurrency. Anyone can read the blockchain, and anyone
can hold a copy of the blockchain, but it is nearly
impossible to counterfeit the blockchain.

Cloud Computing
Typically, application programs are owned by individuals or
organizations and stored on their computer system’s hard
disks. As discussed in Chapter 1, cloud computing uses the
Internet and the web to shift many of these computer
activities from the user’s computer to other computers on
the Internet.
While some suggest that cloud computing is merely a
marketing term designed to promote new products, many others
see cloud computing as a new model for computing that frees
users from owning, maintaining, and storing software and
data. It provides access to these services from anywhere
through an Internet connection. Several prominent firms are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
aggressively pursuing this new concept. These firms include
Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, to name just a few.
The basic components of cloud computing are clients, the
Internet, and service providers. (See Figure 2-22.)
Clients are corporations and end users who want access to
data, programs, and storage. This access is to be available
anywhere and anytime that a connection to the 
Internet is available. End users do not need to
buy, install, and maintain application programs and data.
The Internet provides the connection between the clients
and the providers. Two of the most critical factors
determining the efficiency of cloud computing are (1) the
speed and reliability of the user’s access to the Internet
and (2) the Internet’s capability to provide safe and
reliable transmission of data and programs.
Service providers are organizations with computers
connected to the Internet that are willing to provide
access to software, data, and storage. These providers may
charge a fee or the services may be free. For example,
Google Drive Apps provide free access to programs with
capabilities similar to Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and
PowerPoint. (See Figure 2-23.)

of cloud computing?

The Internet of Things
The Internet is becoming more and more a part of our lives.
As discussed in Chapter 1, the Internet of Things (IoT) is
the continuing development of the Internet that allows
everyday objects embedded with electronic devices to send and
receive data over the Internet. These everyday objects
include cell phones, wearable devices, and even coffeemakers.
For example, the Fitbit is a bracelet that monitors health
data and sends that data to your cell phone or personal web
page. (See Figure 2-24.) Google Nest is a collection of IoT
devices for the home that allow you to answer your front door
when you are not home, improve home security, and automate
your home thermostat.
Figure 2-24 Fitbit

A Web 3.0 application can access the Fitbit data, combine
that data with other data on the web, process the data, and
send information back to another device. For example,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Apple’s Health App, a Web 3.0 application, can access your
Fitbit data, combine it with other related health data,
analyze the data, and report back to you through your cell

including your heart rate, steps taken each day, and an
estimate of daily calories burned. (See Figure 2-25.)

Web developers develop and maintain websites and
resources. The job may include backup of the company
website, updating of resources, or development of new
resources. Web developers are often involved in the design
and development of the website. Some Web developers monitor
traffic on the site and take steps to encourage users to
visit the site. Web developers also may work with marketing
personnel to increase site traffic and may be involved in
the development of web promotions.
Employers look for candidates with a bachelor’s or
associate’s degree in computer science or information
systems and knowledge of common programming languages and
web development software. Knowledge of HTML and PHP is
considered essential. Those with experience using web
authoring software and programs like Adobe Illustrator and
Adobe Dreamweaver are often preferred. Good communication
and organizational skills are vital in this position.
Web developers can expect to earn an annual salary of
$52,000 to $82,000. In larger organizations, this position
may be held by several employees, each specializing in a
specific aspect of the company’s web presence. With
technological advances and increasing corporate emphasis on
a web presence, experience in this field could lead to
managerial opportunities.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Home Smart Home
The technology in our homes has made dull tasks a little easier. Our
parents’ and grandparents’ lives were changed by the introduction of the
vacuum and the washing machine. Today, our lives are further impacted by
new technologies in the home, and the biggest change is the use of the
Internet. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into our
homes and the use of Web 5.0 technologies is doing more than making boring
tasks easier. The future of technology in our homes is smart devices that
monitor and react to us. These technologies will make our homes easier,
healthier, and more sustainable.
Today, smart home systems like Google’s Nest can adjust your
thermostat to keep your home comfortable and energy bills low. Researchers
at Cambridge Consultants are working on even smarter homes that will
reduce waste, increase savings, and make for a more sustainable world. The
smart home of the future will have smart trash cans that monitor and
separate waste, recyclables, and compostable trash. Recyclables and
compost can be repurposed within the home to create energy and reduce
carbon emissions.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

The smart home of the future will do more than clean up and recycle. It
will monitor and adjust energy use based on your needs and the energy
sources available. Interconnected IOT devices will work together to
maximize their efficiency to make for a lower energy home. Devices monitor
inside and outside temperature, news and weather reports, and fluctuating
power availability from home solar panels and community wind turbines.
These homes will also use sensors in the home to predict energy needs,
such as increased hot water in the mornings when people shower and reduced
air conditioning when you go away for a weekend.
Your smart home in the future will not just use less energy. It will
use less space as well. Researchers at Samsung envision a home of smart
walls that use adjustable surfaces and actuators to change the size of a
room effectively, making empty rooms smaller and occupied rooms larger.
When you are entertaining guests, the walls will reposition to create
extra seating directly out of the wall. When the guests leave, the extra
seating disappears back into the wall.
While these advances sound great, perhaps the greatest advantages of a
smart home will be the ability to improve health and longevity. Currently,
researchers are investigating the ways that IoT devices can help people
make healthier choices. The Fitbit and other monitoring IoT wearables have
been shown to increase people’s activity level and improve health. The
smart home of the future will monitor your health and adjust your home to
make healthier choices, from furniture that reads your posture and guides
you to improve how you sit, to refrigerators that monitor your food intake
and promote healthier dining choices. IoT and Web 5.0 will allow smart
homes to work seamlessly in the background to help you achieve your best
you.
Of course, these advances include an increase in potential risks. A
home that records every movement and activity could be used to spy on you.
Companies that store and analyze your smart home data could use that data
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
in ways you haven’t agreed to, such as to sell products or to design and
test new ideas. Finally, by putting your security and privacy in the hands
of a smart home, you risk that smart home being hacked and opening your
home to criminals.
What do you think? Are the conveniences of the smart home of the future
worth the risks to your privacy and security? What smart home features
exist right now that you would like to have? What smart home features that
researchers are working on would be most valuable to you?

Launched in 1969 with ARPANET, the Internet consists of
the actual physical network.
Web
Introduced in 1991, the web (World Wide Web, WWW)
provides a multimedia interface to Internet resources.
Four generations: Web 1.0 (links existing information,
search engines), Web 2.0 (creates dynamic content and
social interaction, social media sites) Web 3.0
(identifies relationships between data), Web 4.0
(creates content from data from mobile devices), and Web
5.0 (identifies and responds to human emotion).
Common Uses
The most common uses of the Internet and the web include
Communication—the most popular Internet activity.
Shopping—one of the fastest-growing Internet
activities.
Searching—access libraries and local, national, and
international news.
Education—e-learning or taking online courses.
Online entertainment—movies, news, music, and video
games.

Once connected to the Internet, your computer seemingly
becomes an extension of a giant computer that branches
all over the world.
Providers
Internet service providers connected to the Internet
provide a path to access the Internet. Connection
technologies include DSL, cable, and wireless modems.
Browsers
Browsers (mobile and desktop) provide access to web
resources. Some related terms are
URLs—locations or addresses to web resources; two
parts are protocol and domain name; top-level domain
(TLD) or web suffix identifies type of organization.
HTML—commands to display web pages; hyperlinks
(links) are connections.
Technologies providing interactive, animated websites
include JavaScript (executes on the user’s computer to
trigger interactive features); PHP (operates within HTML
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
to trigger interactive features and check online forms);
and CSS (controls the appearance of web pages).

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of resources available on the Internet and
web, to be able to access these resources, to
effectively communicate electronically, to efficiently
locate information, to understand electronic commerce,
and to use web utilities.
WEB UTILITIES

Social Networking
Social networking sites connect people and organizations
that share a common interest or activity. Common features
include profiles, pages, groups, friends, news feeds,
and share settings. Two well-known sites are LinkedIn
and Facebook.
Blogs, Microblogs, Podcasts, and Wikis
Other sites that help individuals communicate across the
web are blogs, microblogs, podcasts, and wikis.
Blogs are typically personal websites to keep in touch
with friends and family. Some are like online diaries.
Businesses, newspapers, and others also use blogs as a
quick publishing method.
Microblogs use short sentences. Twitter allows 280
characters per tweet. Instagram is primarily used to
share images and videos.
Podcasts are audio programs delivered over the
Internet. Typically, a podcast is one audio program in
a series of related podcasts.
A wiki is a website designed to allow visitors to use
their browsers to add, edit, or delete the site’s
content. Wikipedia is one of the most popular wikis.

Messaging
Although e-mail is the most widely used, there are two
other messaging systems:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Text messaging, also known as texting and SMS (short
message service), is a process of sending short
electronic messages, typically fewer than 160
characters. Texting while driving is very dangerous and
illegal in several states.
Instant messaging (IM)—supports live communication
between friends. Most instant messaging programs also
include videoconferencing features, file sharing, and
remote assistance.
E-mail
E-mail (electronic mail) is the transmission of
electronic messages. There are two basic types of e-mail
systems:
Client-based e-mail systems use e-mail clients
installed on your computer.
Web-based e-mail systems use webmail clients located
on the e-mail provider’s computer. This is known as
webmail.
A typical e-mail has three basic elements: header
(including address, subject, and perhaps attachment),
message, and signature.
Description
Spam is unwanted and unsolicited e-mail that may
include a computer virus or destructive programs often
attached to unsolicited e-mail. Spam blockers, also
known as spam filters, are programs that identify and
eliminate spam.

SEARCH TOOLS
Search Site
Service
Bing www.bing.com
Duckduckgo www.duckduckgo.com
Google www.google.com
Yahoo! www.yahoo.com
Search services maintain huge databases relating to
website content. The information stored in these
databases includes addresses, content descriptions or
classifications, and keywords appearing on web pages and
other Internet informational resources. Spiders are
programs that update these databases.
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs to help locate
information. To use, enter a keyword or phrase, and a
list of search results is displayed.
Content Evaluation
Not all information you find on the web has been
subjected to strict guidelines to ensure accuracy. Many
sites allow anyone to post new material, sometimes
anonymously and without critical evaluation. Some sites
promote fake news (inaccurate or biased information)
and/or deep fake videos. Many fake news sites are
designed to look like legitimate news sites.
To evaluate the accuracy of information found on the
web, consider the following:
Authority. Is the author an expert? Is the site
official or does it present one individual’s or
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
organization’s opinion?
Accuracy. Consult other reputable sources to verify
surprising claims. Fake news articles often reference
other fake news articles.
Objectivity. Is the information factual or does the
author have a bias? Does the author appear to have a
personal agenda to convince or form a reader’s
opinion?
Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site
specify when information is updated? Are the site’s
links operational?

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the buying and
selling of goods over the Internet. Three basic types are
Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce, which involves
sales from business to the general public.

sales between individuals. Web auctions are similar to
traditional auctions except buyers and sellers rarely,
if ever, meet face to face.
Business-to-business (B2B) commerce, which involves
sales from one business to another, typically a
manufacturer–supplier relationship.
Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are the
development of
Safe, secure payment methods. Two types are credit
cards and digital currency. Bitcoins exist only on the
Internet.
Convenient ways to provide required information.
CLOUD COMPUTING

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Mia, and I’m a software engineer. I’d like to talk
with you about application software and how to access these
traditional programs using cloud computing.”

Not long ago, trained specialists were required to manually perform many
of the operations you can now do with a computer. Market analysts used
calculators to project sales. Graphic artists created designs by hand.
Data processing clerks created electronic files to be stored on large
computers. Now you can do all these tasks—and many others—with a
personal computer and the appropriate application software.
Think of the personal computer as an electronic tool. You may not
consider yourself very good at typing, calculating, organizing,
presenting, or managing information. However, a personal computer can help
you do all these things and much more. All it takes is the right kinds of
software.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the capabilities of general-purpose application software, which includes
word processors, spreadsheets, presentation programs, and database
management systems. You also need to know about integrated packages and
software suites.
Application Software
As we discussed in Chapter 1, there are two kinds of
software. System software works with end users, application
software, and computer hardware to handle the majority of
technical details. Application software can be described as
end-user software and is used to accomplish a variety of
tasks.
Application software can be divided into three categories.
One of the most popular categories, mobile apps, consist of
applications designed for cell phones and tablets. Another
category, general-purpose applications, includes word
processing programs, presentation software, spreadsheets, and
database management systems. Finally, specialized
applications include thousands of programs that are more
narrowly focused on specific disciplines and occupations.
App Stores
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
An app store is where you can download applications to work
with your mobile, laptop, and desktop devices. Some
applications are free, but many cost a nominal fee. Three of
the best-known app stores are Apple’s App Store, Google
Play, and the Microsoft Store (See Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1 Apple’s App Store
A9 STUDIO/Shutterstock
Applications are written for a particular type of device.
For example, an app designed for Apple’s iPhone will not
work on a Windows laptop. Therefore, most app stores focus on
apps for a particular type of device. For example, the
Microsoft Store focuses on apps for Windows laptops and
desktops, while the Apple App Store has apps designed to work
on Apple devices. For a list of some of the more widely used
app stores, see Figure 3-2.

User Interface
A user interface is the portion of the application that
allows you to control and to interact with the program.
Depending on the application, you can use a mouse, a
keyboard, a stylus, a finger, and/or your voice to
communicate with the application. Most general-purpose
applications use a mouse and a graphical user interface
(GUI) that displays graphical elements called icons to
represent familiar objects. The mouse controls a 
pointer on the screen that is used to select items
such as icons. Another feature is the use of windows to
display information. A window is simply a rectangular area
that can contain a document, program, or message. (Do not
confuse the term window with the various versions of
Microsoft’s Windows operating systems, which are programs.)
More than one window can be opened and displayed on the
computer screen at one time.
The standard GUI uses a system of menus, toolbars, and
dialog boxes. (See Figure 3-3.)
Menus present commands that are typically displayed in a
menu bar at the top of the screen.
Toolbars typically appear below the menu bar and include
small graphic elements called buttons that provide
shortcuts for quick access to commonly used commands.
Dialog boxes provide additional information and request
user input.

Figure 3-3 Traditional graphical user interface
Microsoft Corporation
Description
Many applications, and Microsoft applications in
particular, use an interface known as the Ribbon GUI, which
changes based on the needs of the user. This GUI uses a
system of interrelated ribbons, tabs, and galleries. (See
Figure 3-4.)
Ribbons replace toolbars and menus by organizing commonly
used commands into sets of related activities. These
activities are displayed as tabs and appear in the first
ribbon.
Tabs divide the ribbon into major activity areas. 
Each tab is then organized into groups that contain
related items. Some tabs, called contextual tabs, appear
only when they are needed and anticipate the next operation
to be performed by the user.

Common Features
Most applications provide a variety of features to make
entering/presenting, editing, and formatting documents easy.
Some of the most common features include
Spelling and grammar checker—looks for misspelled words or
grammatical errors.
Alignment—centers, right-aligns, or left-aligns numbers
and characters.

Fonts and font sizes—specify the size and style of entered
numbers and text.
Character effects—provide a variety of different
typefaces, such as bold or italics.
Edit options—provide easy ways to edit text, such as cut,
copy, and paste.
Find and replace—searches a document for a specific word
or phrase, with the option to replace the word or phrase
with something else.

Fake Reviews
Shopping apps help customers make smart purchases by posting
consumers’ reviews of products. For example, Amazon allows its
community of users to rate products from one to five stars. You can
even search for products based on the product’s average star rating.
Unfortunately, these ratings can also be faked; there are entire
companies that offer services to post fake reviews and falsely improve
a product’s ratings. Some feel that Amazon should be held responsible
for making sure its star rankings are truthful, while others suggest it
is the company’s responsibility. Do you trust online reviews? Should
companies be held accountable for the reviews posted on its site, or is
it a case of “buyer beware”?

Mobile Apps
Mobile apps or mobile applications are add-on programs for a
variety of mobile devices, including cell phones and tablets.
Sometimes referred to simply as apps, mobile apps have been
widely used for years. The traditional applications include
address books, to-do lists, alarms, and message lists. With
the introduction of cell phones, tablets, and wireless
connections to the Internet, mobile capabilities are almost
limitless. See Figure 3-5 for a list of some of the most
widely used mobile apps.

The breadth and scope of available mobile applications for
cell phones and other mobile devices are ever expanding.
There are over 3.5 million mobile apps on the Google Play
store alone. Some of the most widely used are for listening
to music, viewing video, social networking, shopping, and
game playing.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Music apps stream music, organize playlists, and recommend
new artists. The Spotify app offers free music with ads.
For a monthly fee, apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music
offer ad-free listening, offline listening, and other extra
features.
Video apps are a favorite way to watch movie trailers and
video blogs. The YouTube app offers access to free online
videos such as movie trailers and video blogs. The Netflix
app provides access to more professional videos for a fee.
Social networking apps let you use your mobile device to
share vacation photos, check in at your favorite coffee
shop, or invite friends to a party. The most widely used
social media app is Facebook, but other apps, such as
Instagram and TikTok, are gaining in popularity.
Shopping apps make shopping online quick and easy. These
apps will help you find products, read customer reviews,
and make purchases.
Gaming apps are an enjoyable way to pass the time 
on a cell phone. Some game apps cost money, but
others work on a free-to-play model, where the initial game
is free, but the more advanced features require an in-app
purchase. Games vary from Crossy-road, a simple arcade-
style game, to Stardew Valley, a complex role-playing game
(RPG) where gamers create a farm, grow crops, and raise
livestock. (See Figure 3-6.)

privacy
Although mobile apps on your cell phone are an amazing way to share
your life with friends and family on social media, it is easy to forget
that these apps are constantly recording your location, photos you
take, and local businesses that you visit. Privacy advocates are
concerned that this data might be used for unintended purposes. For
example, employers could access and use this information when deciding
who to hire. In fact, such cases are documented. Employers argue that
they should consider every aspect of a future or current employee,
including how an employee’s media presence could reflect on the
company. What do you think?
Many apps are written for a particular type of mobile
device and will not run on other types. For example, an app
designed for Apple’s iPhone may not work with Google’s
Android.

General-Purpose Applications
As mentioned previously, general-purpose applications include
word processors, spreadsheets, presentation software, and
database management systems.
Word Processors
Word processors create text-based documents and are one of
the most flexible and widely used software tools. All types
of people and organizations use word processors to create
memos, letters, and reports. Organizations create
newsletters, manuals, and brochures to provide information to
their customers. Students and researchers use word processors
to create reports.
Microsoft Word is the most widely used word processor.
Other popular word processors include Apple Pages and Google
Docs.
Assume that you have accepted a job as an advertising
coordinator for Adventure Travel Tours, a travel agency
specializing in active adventure vacations. Your primary
responsibilities are to create and coordinate the company’s
promotional materials, including flyers and travel reports.
To see how you could use Microsoft Word as the advertising
coordinator for the Adventure Travel Tours, see Figures 3-7

Creating a Flyer
You have been asked to create a promotional advertising flyer. After
discussing the flyer’s content and basic structure with your supervisor,
you start to enter the flyer’s text. As you enter the text, the spell
checker and grammar checker catch some spelling and grammatical errors.
Once the text has been entered, you proofread the text and then focus
your attention on enhancing the visual aspects of the flyer. You add a
photograph and experiment with different character and paragraph formats,
including fonts, font sizes, colors, and alignments.

Creating a Report
Your next assignment is to create a report on Tanzania and Peru. After
conducting your research, you start writing your paper. As you enter the
text for the report, you notice that the AutoCorrect feature
automatically corrects some grammar and punctuation errors. Your report
includes several figures and tables. You use the captions feature to keep
track of figure and table numbers, to enter the caption text, and to
position the captions. You use the footnote feature to assist in adding
notes to further explain or comment on information in the report.
Finally, you prepare the report for printing by adding header and
footer information.

Presentation Software
Presentation software are programs that combine a variety of
visual objects to create attractive, visually interesting
presentations. They are excellent tools to communicate a
message and to persuade people.
People in a variety of settings and situations use
presentation software programs to make their presentations.
For example, marketing managers use presentation software to
present proposed marketing strategies to their superiors.
Salespeople use these programs to demonstrate products and
encourage customers to make purchases. Students use
presentation software to create high-quality class
presentations.
Three of the most widely used presentation software
programs are Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, and Google
Slides.
Assume that you have volunteered for the Animal Rescue
Foundation, a local animal rescue agency. You have been asked
to create a powerful and persuasive presentation to encourage
other members from your community to volunteer. To see how
you could use Microsoft PowerPoint, see Figure 3-9.

Creating a Presentation
You have been asked to create a powerful and persuasive presentation for
the director of the foundation designed to encourage other members from
your community to volunteer. The first step is to meet with the director
of the foundation to determine the content of the presentation. Then,
using PowerPoint, you begin creating the presentation by selecting a
presentation template and document theme. After entering the content, you
add interest to the presentation by adding animation to selected objects
and using slide transition effects.

Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets organize, analyze, and graph numeric data such
as budgets and financial reports. Once used exclusively by
accountants, spreadsheets are widely used by nearly every
profession. Marketing professionals analyze sales trends.
Financial analysts evaluate and graph stock market trends.
Students and teachers record grades and calculate grade point
averages.
The most widely used spreadsheet program is Microsoft
Excel. Other spreadsheet applications include Apple Numbers
and Google Sheets.
Assume that you have just accepted a job as manager of the
Downtown Internet Café. This café provides a variety of

Your first project is to develop a first-quarter sales forecast for the
café. You begin by studying sales data and talking with several managers.
After obtaining sales and expense estimates, you are ready to create the
first-quarter forecast. You start structuring the worksheet by inserting
descriptive text entries for the row and column headings. Next, you
insert numeric entries, including formulas and functions to perform
calculations. To test the accuracy of the worksheet, you change the
values in some cells and compare the recalculated spreadsheet results
with hand calculations.

Analyzing Your Data
After presenting the First-Quarter Forecast to the owner, you revise the
format and expand the workbook to include worksheets for each quarter and
an annual forecast summary. You give each worksheet a descriptive sheet
name. At the request of the owner, you perform a what-if analysis to test
the effect of different estimates for payroll, and you use a chart to
visualize the effect.

Database Management Systems
A database is a collection of related data. It is the
electronic equivalent of a file cabinet. A database
management system (DBMS) or database manager is a program
that sets up, or structures, a database. It also provides
tools to enter, edit, and retrieve data from the database.
All kinds of individuals use databases, from hospital
administrators recording patient information to police

officers checking criminal histories. Colleges and
universities use databases to keep records on their students,
instructors, and courses. Organizations of all types maintain
employee databases.

Specialized Applications
While general-purpose applications are widely used in nearly
every profession, specialized applications are widely used
within specific professions. These programs include graphics
programs and web authoring programs.
Graphics Programs
Graphics programs are widely used by professionals in the
graphic arts profession. They use video editors, image
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
editing programs, illustration programs, and desktop
publishing programs.
Video editors are used to edit videos to enhance quality
and appearance of the videos you capture using your cell
phone or other devices. You can readily add special
effects, music tracks, titles, and on-screen graphics.
Just a few years ago, video editors were used only by
professionals with expensive specialized hardware and
software. Now, there are several free or inexpensive
editors designed to assist the amateur videographer. Three
well-known video editors are Movavi Video Editor Plus for
Android phones and tablets, Apple iMovie for apple devices,
and Adobe Premier Elements 2021 for a professional tool on
laptops and desktops. (See Figure 3-13.)
Image editors, also known as photo editors, are 
specialized graphics programs for editing or
modifying digital photographs. They are often used to touch
up photographs to remove scratches and other imperfections.
The photographs consist of thousands of dots, or pixels,
that form images, often referred to as bitmap or raster
images. One limitation of bitmap images, however, is that
when they are expanded, the images can become pixelated, or
jagged on the edges. For example, when the letter A in
Figure 3-14 is expanded, the borders of the letter appear
jagged, as indicated by the expanded view.
For cell phones and tablets, Snapseed is a popular image
editor. Most laptops and desktops come with a free photo
editor; the two most common are Microsoft Photo and
Apple’s Photos. Finally, for professional photographers,
Adobe Photoshop is the gold standard in image editors.
Illustration programs, also known as drawing programs, are
used to create and edit vector images. While bitmap images
use pixels to represent images, vector images, also known
as vector illustrations, use geometric shapes or objects.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
These objects are created by connecting lines and curves,
avoiding the pixeleted or ragged edges created by bitmap
images. (See Figure 3-15.) Because these objects can be
defined by mathematical equations, they can be rapidly and
easily resized, colored, textured, and manipulated. An
image is a combination of several objects.
Illustration programs are often used for graphic design,
page layout, and creating sharp artistic images. Popular
illustration programs include Procreate, Adobe Illustrator
Draw, and Autodesk Sketchbook.
Desktop publishing programs, or page layout programs,
allow you to mix text and graphics to create publications
of professional quality. While word processors focus on
creating text and have the ability to combine text and
graphics, desktop publishers focus on page design and
layout and provide greater flexibility. Professional
graphic artists use desktop publishing programs to create
documents such as brochures, newsletters, newspapers, and
textbooks.
Popular desktop publishing programs include Adobe
InDesign, Microsoft Publisher, and QuarkXPress. These
programs provide the capability to create text and
graphics; however, typically graphic artists import these
elements from other sources, including word processors,
digital cameras, scanners, image editors, illustration
programs, and image galleries.

ethics
Image editing software has made it easy to alter any photo or video to
correct for a variety of different imperfections. However, some
professionals can use these programs to significantly manipulate the
content or meaning of a photo or video. Such changes are often intended
to influence the opinions or emotions of the viewer. Supporters argue
that this type of editing is acceptable and is just another way to
express an opinion or feeling from an editor. Critics note that this
type of image and video manipulation is unethical because it
intentionally misleads the viewer and often creates unobtainable or
unhealthy definitions of beauty. What do you think?

world like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto, you can
experiment and create some impressive games on your own with
the right software. The first step is to visualize the game
by thinking about the game’s length and plot. The second
step is to choose the right video game design software.

Video game design software will help you organize your
thoughts and guide you through the game design process,
including character development and environmental design.
There are many choices from free software to very expensive
software designed for professional game designers. The video
game design software behind some of the biggest games include
the Unreal Game Engine, the Unity development kit, and
GameMaker Studio 2. (See Figure 3-16.)

tips
Do you take photos with your cell phone? Almost everyone does.
Here are some suggestions to keep in mind.
1
Quickly launch the camera app. Sometimes a photo opportunity
comes along and you don’t have time to log into your cell phone.
Did you know that you can quickly access your cell phone’s camera
without logging in?
For Android cell phones: Double-click the power button.
For iOS cell phones: Tap the screen to wake up your phone, then
swipe left.
2
Compose your shot. Your cell phone camera can help you line up or
balance your photos by displaying gridlines on the screen.
For Android cell phones: Open the camera app, open settings,
and turn on the Assistive Grid option.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the settings icon from the home
screen, then select Camera. Finally, turn on the Grid option.
Web Authoring Programs
There are over a billion websites on the Internet, and more
are being added every day. Corporations use the web to reach
new customers and to promote their products. Individuals
create online diaries or commentaries, called blogs. Creating
a site is called web authoring.
Almost all websites consist of interrelated web pages. As
we mentioned in Chapter 2, web pages are typically HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (cascading style sheets)
documents. With knowledge of HTML and a simple text editor,
you can create web pages. Even without knowledge of HTML, you
can create simple web pages using a word processing package
like Microsoft Word.
More specialized and powerful programs, called web
authoring programs, are typically used to create
sophisticated commercial sites. Also known as web page
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
editors and HTML editors, these programs provide support for
website design and HTML coding. Some web authoring programs
are WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which
means you can build a page without interacting directly with
HTML code. WYSIWYG editors preview the page described by HTML
code. Widely used web authoring programs include Adobe
Dreamweaver and Froala 4.0.

Other Specialized Applications
There are numerous other specialized applications, including
accounting, personal finance, and project management
applications. Accounting applications such as Intuit
QuickBooks help companies record and report their financial
operations. Personal financial applications such as Quicken
Starter Edition help individuals track their personal
finances and investments. Project management software like
Microsoft Project is widely used in business to help
coordinate and plan complicated projects.

Software Suites
A software suite is a collection of separate application
programs bundled together and made available as a group. Four
types of suites are office suites, cloud suites, specialized
suites, and utility suites.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Office Suites
Office suites, also known as office software suites and
productivity suites, contain general-purpose application
programs that are typically used in a business situation.
Productivity suites commonly include a word processor,
spreadsheet, database manager, and a presentation
application. The best known is Microsoft Office. Another
well-known productivity suite is Apple iWork.
Cloud Computing
Cloud suites or online office suites are stored at a server
on the Internet and are available anywhere you can access the
Internet. Documents created using cloud applications can also
be stored online, making it easy to share and collaborate on
documents with others. One downside to cloud applications is
that you are dependent on the server providing the
application to be available whenever you need it. For this
reason, when using cloud applications, it is important to
have backup copies of your documents on your computer and to
have a desktop office application available to use. Popular
cloud office suites include Google Workspace Microsoft 365
and Apple iWorks. (See Figure 3-17.) To learn more about
cloud office suites, see Making IT Work for You: Cloud Office
Suites on pages 74 and 75.

AJR_photo/Shutterstock
Software engineers analyze users’ needs and create
application software. Software engineers typically have
experience in programming but focus on the design and
development of programs using the principles of mathematics
and engineering.
A bachelor’s or an advanced specialized associate’s
degree in computer science or information systems and an
extensive knowledge of computers and technology are
required by most employers. Internships may provide
students with the kinds of experience employers look for in
a software engineer. Those with specific experience with
web applications may have an advantage over other
applicants. Employers typically look for software engineers
with good communication and analytical skills.
Software engineers can expect to earn an annual salary
in the range of $63,000 to $148,000. Starting salary is
dependent on both experience and the type of software being
developed. Experienced software engineers are candidates
for many other advanced careers in IT.

Making IT work for you
CLOUD OFFICE SUITES
Do you work with a team on documents, presentations, or
spreadsheets? Do your teammates use different computers
and work in different locations? Do you sometimes need to
work remotely—from home, a hotel, or in a coffee shop?
Remote team work is growing in popularity, and cloud
office suites can give you the tools to succeed.
Choosing a Cloud Office Suite The three biggest cloud office suites
are Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Apple’s iWork. Each is unique,
with different prices, strengths, and weaknesses. Here are a few things
to consider when choosing a cloud office suite for your team:
What does your team use now? To use a cloud office suite, everyone
in your team will need to sign up online and set up their devices.
This can be time-consuming, but if you are already using one of these
tools, the work may already be done. For example, if your team
currently uses Google Docs, setting up a collaborative workspace could
be as simple as sending an e-mail.
How experienced are your teammates? A team knowledgable in
Microsoft Office can produce impressive, customized results quickly
and professionally. However, the time and training necessary to become
an expert in Microsoft Office may be too much for teammates with
little or no computer experience. Other collaborative office suites,
such as Apple iWorks and Google Workspace, are recognized as being
easier for new users.
When choosing a cloud office suite, consider the experience and
knowledge of your teammates to make the best choice for your team.
Each cloud suite offers different online storage options and price
points. To learn more about pricing and options, check out these
websites:

Collaborative office suites, like Microsoft 365, often emphasize their
ease of setup and tools for working with co-workers.

Collaborating with Your Group Online collaborative office suite tools
share many important features:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Document versions—When changes are made to a document by members of
the team, the collaborative tools create a new version of the
document. This feature allows team members to explore changes in the
document without fear of losing important work.
Member changes—when a team member changes a document, the
collaborative tool tells the group about the change by highlighting
the change and identifying who made it. Use this tool to track
members’ impact on the document and to quickly see what changes have
been made.
Adding members to the team—As the document progresses, you may
want to get more opinions. Collaborative tools let you add new people
to your team, but also limit what they can do. Some team members may
be able to view and edit the document, whereas others may only be able
to view it. This is a good tool to show someone your work without
concern that they might accidentally edit something.
Most collaborative cloud office suites, like Google Workspace, offer the
ability to see who made changes to a document and when and to undo those
changes if necessary.
Google, INC.
Mobile Tools For many, working at a laptop or desktop computer is the
easiest way to compose a document or presentation. However, when
traveling on a crowded plane or walking down the hallway with a
classmate, you can use cloud office suites on your tablet or phone. This
is a great way to review a document, make a small comment, or quickly
show a document to a teacher or friend. Apple, Google, and Microsoft all
have apps to download to cell phones and tablets that allow you to view
your online documents and make simple changes with interfaces designed
for the smaller screens and touch interfaces of tablets and cell phones.

Many office suites, like Apple’s iWorks, are designed to work with
mobile devices and offline utility suites, such as Apple’s word
processor, Pages, which has apps for computers, laptops, and cell phones.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The New Workplace Realities
Working from home has become increasingly popular. Many no longer commute
to work but, instead, have a home office or work from the kitchen table.
However, working from home is lacking in important features that office
buildings provided. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
technologies offer a future where you still work from home but experience
all the benefits of working at the office. The future office building may
be located in virtual reality, and the next meeting you have may be a
blend of physical and virtual elements that make up augmented reality.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Augmented reality glasses and complex camera arrays are looking to
vastly change the way in which we videoconference. Imagine a meeting
between yourself in L.A. and a co-worker in London. You both enter
specialized rooms with multiple cameras that capture your position and
appearance. You both wear augmented reality eyeglasses. In London, your
co-worker sits down at a table. AR software records her position and
appearance in London and sends that information to you in L.A. Your AR
software projects the appearance and position of your co-worker onto the
transparent AR glasses. Although you can see the room around you, the
image of your co-worker is overlaid on your vision of the room to give the
appearance that she is in the room as well.
Milles Studio/Shutterstock
As the meeting progresses, you present your ideas to your co-worker
through charts and graphs. These charts float around the room in virtual
screens. You decide to bring in a third member to the meeting. Your co-
workers in the office outside the augmented reality meeting room are using
virtual reality headsets, doing their work in virtual offices. You ask
your manager to join you, and the manager joins the meeting by changing
his virtual location to the meeting room. Because the VR headset covers
your manager’s face, he appears in the room as an avatar, a virtual
representation of your manager.
Virtual reality office spaces have the potential to completely remove
the need for office space. Workers could use VR software at home and
complete their work with co-workers in a virtual office. Augmented reality
programs could allow you to try on clothes without going to the store,

overlaying a projection of an outfit to model the style and fit of a
garment. Although not common yet, these tools are currently being
developed by researchers and scientists.
Soon the glasses themselves may be unnecessary. Developments in
flexible and translucent screens may one day be so compact that your AR
glasses could be AR contact lenses. Scientists at UC Berkley are working
on a power supply that is the size of a grain of rice and transmits power
through ultrasonic pulses—allowing energy to pass through the body and be
absorbed by the power supply. In this future, a computer screen will
always be at your disposal, with hand gestures and head position monitored
to create virtual keyboards that only you can see. Would you enjoy working
at a virtual desk and attending virtual meetings, or do you think that
virtual work would be less productive?

When most people use a computer, they use a cell phone to send messages,
play games, or view social media. We typically think of using a computer
as using the applications that have become an important part of our
everyday lives. Most of us agree that they are great … as long as they
are working.
We usually do not think about the more mundane and behind-the-scenes
computer activities: loading and running programs, coordinating networks
that share resources, organizing files, protecting us from viruses,
performing periodic maintenance to avoid problems, and controlling
hardware devices so that they can communicate with one another. Typically,
these activities go on behind the scenes without our help.
That is the way it should be, and the way it is, as long as everything
is working perfectly. But what if new application programs are not
compatible and will not run on our current computer system? What if we get
a computer virus? What if our hard disk fails? What if we buy a new
digital video camera and can’t store and edit the images on our computer
system? What if our computer starts to run slower and slower?
These issues may seem mundane, but they are critical. This chapter
covers the vital activities that go on behind the scenes. A little
knowledge about these activities can go a long way to making your
computing life easier. To efficiently and effectively use computers, you
need to understand the functionality of system software, including
operating systems, utility programs, and device drivers.
System Software
End users use application software to accomplish specific
tasks. For example, we use messaging applications to send
text and photos with our cell phones. However, end users also
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
use system software. System software works with end users,
application software, and computer hardware to handle the
majority of technical details. For example, system software
controls where a word processing program is stored in memory,
how commands are converted so that the system unit can
process them, and where a completed document or file is
saved. (See Figure 4-1.)

Description
System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a
collection or a system of programs that handle hundreds of
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
technical details with little or no user intervention. System
software consists of four types of programs:
Operating systems coordinate computer resources, provide an
interface between users and the computer, and run
applications.
Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing
computer resources.
Device drivers are specialized programs that allow
particular input or output devices to communicate with the
rest of the computer system.
Language translators convert the programming instructions
written by programmers into a language that computers
understand and process.

Operating Systems
An operating system is a collection of programs that handle
many of the technical details related to using a computer. In
many ways, an operating system is the most important type of
computer program. Without a functioning operating system,
your computer would be useless.
ethics
As our devices have gotten smarter, their operating systems have begun
accepting voice commands. This allows a user to speak commands to the
device. A device may be controlled by speaking a key phrase—such as
“OK Google,” “Hey Siri,” or “Alexa”—followed by a command or
question, such as “what time is it?” In order for the device to
recognize when a user says the device’s key phrase, it must always be
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
recording and analyzing users’ conversations. These recordings are
often shared over the Internet with companies that use this information
to improve the voice recognition software and search tools. Could such
data be used unethically? Who should oversee this data, and what limits
should be placed on its use?
Functions
Every computer has an operating system, and every operating
system performs a variety of functions. These functions can
be classified into three groups:
Managing resources: Operating systems coordinate all the
computer’s resources, including memory, processing,
storage, and devices such as printers and monitors. They
also monitor system performance, schedule tasks, provide
security, and start up the computer.
Providing user interface: Operating systems allow users to
interact with application programs and computer hardware
through a user interface. Originally, operating systems
used a character-based interface in which users
communicated with the operating system through written
commands such as “Copy A: report.txt C:”. Today, most
operating systems use a graphical user interface (GUI). As
we discussed in Chapter 3, a graphical user interface uses
graphical elements such as icons and windows. More
recently, many operating systems now include voice assist
tools. Much like a graphical user interface offers users a
visual way to interact with application programs 
and computer hardware, voice assist tools allows a
user to directly issue voice commands.
Running applications: Operating systems load and run
applications such as word processors and spreadsheets. Most
operating systems support multitasking, or the ability to
switch between different applications stored in memory.
With multitasking, you could have a web browser and a
messaging app running at the same time and switch easily
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
between the two applications. The program that you are
currently working on is described as running in the
foreground. The other program or programs are running in
the background.
community
Did you know that your operating system plays a key role in making sure
that everybody has access to technology? All major operating systems
include accessibility features that make our devices easier to use for
people with disabilities. For people with low vision, there are tools
to magnify portions of the screen or read written text out loud. For
people with dyslexia, there are fonts that can make identifying letters
and words easier. For the deaf or hard of hearing, audible alerts can
be set to also offer visual cues, like flashing the screen when a beep
or noise is played. These features are included free in your device’s
operating system, and you can configure them in your device’s settings
menus.
Features
Starting or restarting a computer is called booting the
system. There are two ways to boot a computer: a warm boot
and a cold boot. A warm boot occurs when the computer is
already on and you restart it without turning off the power.
A warm boot can be accomplished in several ways. For many
computer systems, they can be restarted by simply pressing a
sequence of keys. Starting a computer that has been turned
off is called a cold boot.
You typically interact with the operating system through
the graphical user interface. Most provide a place, called
the desktop, that provides access to computer resources. (See
Figure 4-2.) Some important features common to most operating
systems and application programs include:
Icons—graphic representations for a program, type of file,
or function.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Pointer—controlled by a mouse, trackpad, or touch screen,
the pointer changes shape depending on its current
function. For example, when shaped like an arrow, the
pointer can be used to select items such as an icon.
Windows—rectangular areas for displaying 
information and running programs.
Menus—provide a list of options or commands that can be
selected.
Tabs—divide menus into major activity areas such as format
and page layout.
Dialog boxes—typically provide information or request
input.
Help—provides online assistance for operating system

Description
Most offices have filing cabinets that store important
documents in folders. Similarly, most operating systems store
data and programs in a system of files and folders. Files are
used to store data and programs. Related files are stored
within a folder, and, for organizational purposes, a folder
can contain other folders, or subfolders. For example, you
might organize your electronic files in the Documents folder
on your hard disk. This folder could contain other folders,
each named to indicate its contents. One might be “Computer
Class” and could contain all the files you have created (or
will create) for this course.
Categories
While there are hundreds of different operating systems,
there are only three basic categories: embedded, stand-alone,
and network.
Embedded operating systems are used in cell phones and
tablets, as well as video game systems and thousands of
other small electronic devices. Also known as real-time
operating systems (RTOS), these operating systems are
uniquely designed to work exclusively with (i.e., embedded
into) a particular device’s hardware. Typically designed
for a specific application, embedded operating systems are
essential in the evolution of IoT where many everyday
devices are able to communicate with one another, as
discussed in Chapter 1. For example, Watch OS was developed
by Apple exclusively for the Apple Watch. (See Figure 4-3.)
Stand-alone operating systems are used in a single desktop
or laptop computer. (See Figure 4-4.) Also called desktop
operating systems, these operating systems are located on

the computer’s hard disk. Often desktop computers and
laptops are part of a network. In these cases, the desktop
operating system works with the network to share and
coordinate resources. Two of the most popular stand-alone
operating systems are Apple’s macOS and Microsoft’s
Windows.
Network operating systems (NOS) are used to control and
coordinate computers that are networked or linked together.
These networks can range in size, from a few computers in
an office to large networks that spans an entire company or
university. An NOS can be composed of several smaller
networks and many types of computers.
Network operating systems are typically located on one
of the connected computers’ hard disks. Called the network
server, this computer coordinates all communication between
the other computers. Popular network operating systems
include Linux, Windows Server, and UNIX.

The operating system is often referred to as the software
environment or software platform. A computer’s platform
dictates what applications will run on that 
device. Almost all application programs are
designed to run with a specific platform. For example,
Apple’s iMovie software is designed to run with the macOS
environment and will not run on an Android cell phone or
Windows laptop. Many applications, however, have different
versions, each designed to operate with a particular
platform. For example, there are two versions of Microsoft
Office, one designed to work with Windows and another
designed to work with macOS.

Mobile Operating Systems
Mobile operating systems, also known as mobile OS, are a
type of embedded operating system. Just like other computer
systems, mobile computers—including cell phones, tablets,
and wearable computers—require an operating system. These
mobile operating systems are less complicated and more
specialized for wireless communication.
While there are numerous mobile operating systems, two of
the best known are Android and iOS.
Android was developed by Google and is used as the platform
for many popular cell phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S1

Desktop Operating Systems
Every personal computer has an operating system controlling
its operations. The most widely used desktop operating
systems are Windows, macOS, UNIX, and Linux.
Windows
Microsoft’s Windows is the most widely used personal
computer operating system. Because its market share is so
large, more application programs have been developed to run
under Windows than any other operating system. Windows comes
in a variety of different versions and is designed to run
with a variety of different microprocessors.
The most recent version of Windows, Windows 11, was
announced in 2021. (See Figure 4-6.) Windows 11 is
Microsoft’s desktop, laptop, and tablet operating system.
This version of Windows includes several innovations, such as
a simplified user interface and improved support for mobile
devices, such as tablets and 2-in-1 laptops. One of the
biggest changes with Windows 11 is its ability to run Android
apps on a Windows device.

Most cell phone operating systems include a virtual assistant, like
Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant, that scans your personal information
such as calendar events, e-mails, text messages, and GPS location to
anticipate your needs and help organize your life. However, most users
of these complex programs are unaware that they copy and transfer data
from texts, e-mails, and GPS back to company servers. Should your
operating system be gathering and sharing this data? Who should be in
charge of what data is gathered and how it is stored?
macOS
Apple has been the leader in the development of powerful and
easy-to-use personal computer operating systems since its
introduction of the Macintosh personal computer in 1984.
Designed to run only with Apple computers, macOS is not as
widely used as the Windows operating system. As a result,
fewer application programs have been written for it. However,
with increasing sales of Apple computers, the use of macOS
has been rapidly increasing and is widely recognized as one
of the most innovative operating systems. The popular iOS and
iPadOS mobile operating systems are based off the macOS.
macOS is the most widely used Mac desktop operating
system. macOS 12 Monterey, announced in 2021, includes the
ability to control multiple devices from one keyboard and
mouse, improved videoconferencing tools, and ways to
customize notifications to reduce distractions when working.

UNIX and Linux
The UNIX operating system was originally designed in the late
1960s to run on minicomputers in network environments. Over
the years, UNIX has evolved with numerous different versions.
Now, it is widely used by servers on the web, mainframe
computers, and very powerful personal computers. There are a
large number of different versions of UNIX.
Linux is an operating system that extended one of the UNIX
versions. It was originally developed by a graduate student
at the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds, in 1991. He
allowed free distribution of the operating system code and
encouraged others to modify and further develop the code.
Programs released in this way are called open source. Linux
is a popular and powerful alternative to the Windows
operating system. (See Figure 4-8.) Linux has been the basis
of several other operating systems. For example, Google’s
Chrome OS and the Android mobile operating system are based
on Linux.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 4-8 Linux

Chrome OS integrates with web servers to run applications
and to perform other traditional operating system functions.
This capability has made Chrome OS a popular choice for
inexpensive notebook computers that use cloud computing and
cloud storage to do things that would normally require much
more expensive hardware. One limitation of these computers is
that their efficiency is dependent upon the speed of their
Internet connection.
Virtualization
As we have discussed, application programs are designed to
run with particular operating systems. What if you wanted to
run two or more applications, each requiring a different
operating system? One solution would be to install each of
the operating systems on a different computer. There is,
however, a way in which a single physical computer can
support multiple operating systems that operate
independently. This approach is called virtualization.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
When a single physical computer runs a special program
known as virtualization software, it operates as though it
were two or more separate and independent computers, known as
virtual machines. Each virtual machine appears to the user as
a separate, independent computer with its own operating
system. The operating system of the physical machine is known
as the host operating system. The operating system for each
virtual machine is known as the guest operating system.
Users can readily switch between virtual computers and
programs running on them. There are several programs that
create and run virtual machines. Two such programs, Parallels
and VMware, allow a user on a Mac to run Windows programs in
macOS. (See Figure 4-9.)

Utilities
Ideally, personal computers would continuously run without
problems. However, that simply is not the case. All kinds of
things can happen such as files or apps can go missing,
storage space can fill up, and data can be lost. These events
can make computing very frustrating. That’s where utilities
come in. Utilities are specialized programs designed to make
computing easier. There are hundreds of different utility
programs. The most essential are
Search programs provide a quick and easy way to search or
examine an entire computer system to help you find specific
applications, data, or other files.
Storage management programs help solve the problem of
running out of storage space by providing lists of
application programs, stored videos, and other program
files so that you can eliminate unused applications or
archive large files elsewhere.
Backup programs make copies of files to be used in case the
originals are lost or damaged. Windows 11 comes with a free
backup program, the File History tool, and macOS has a
backup feature named Time Machine.
Antivirus programs guard your computer system against
viruses or other damaging programs that can invade your
computer system. Popular antivirus programs include Norton
AntiVirus and Bitdefender’s Antivirus Plus.

Virtual assistants are utilities that accept commands
through text or speech to allow intuitive interaction with
your computer, cell phone, or tablet and coordinate
personal data across multiple applications. Microsoft
Windows 11 has the virtual assistant Cortana, and Apple’s
macOS has Siri. To learn more about virtual assistants, see
the Making IT Work for You: Virtual Assistant on pages 94
and 95.
Most operating systems provide some utility programs. Even
more powerful utility programs can be purchased separately or
in utility suites.

Making IT work for you
VIRTUAL ASSISTANT
Your cell phone already organizes much of your life. It
contains a list of your contacts, alarms and timers you
can set, and a calendar of upcoming events. However,
coordinating all these details can be challenging. Virtual
assistants can help you manage your day, review e-mails
and texts, and even suggest local restaurants.
What Is a Virtual Assistant? As defined earlier, a virtual assistant
is a utility that coordinates personal data across several applications
and provides a more intuitive way to interact with your computer, phone,
or tablet. Most operating systems offer a virtual assistant; Apple offers
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Siri, Microsoft has Cortana, Amazon has Alexa, and Google has Google
Assistant. The most common way to interact with these utilities is
through voice commands.
Google Assistant lets a user dictate a text message. Most intelligent
assistants will coordinate with your phone’s features to send texts and
e-mails, or make calls.
Google Inc.
Voice Assist One of the most important features of your virtual
assistant is its ability to listen to spoken commands and respond
verbally. This allows you to text, review e-mails, and even schedule
events while keeping your hands free.
Apple’s Siri accepts a voice command to make a phone call. Intelligent
assistants interpret voice commands and can perform simple actions, such
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
as setting alarms, sending e-mails or text messages, and alerting you to
upcoming calendar events.
Apple Inc.
Initially, you must get your assistant’s attention with a key phrase,
such as Hey Siri, OK Google, or Hey Cortana, depending on your device.
After you alert your virtual assistant that you want help, you can ask it
to manage your personal information or look up information on the
Internet. Some common requests are:
“What is the weather like today?”
“Do I have any new e-mails?”
“Add milk to the grocery list.”
“Text Mom that I am going to be late.”

Making Plans Many virtual assistants review your e-mail and text
messages for key words that indicate a calendar event. Virtual assistants
scan texts and e-mails for indications of calendar events, such as a text
that reads “Dinner tomorrow at 8 pm?” or an e-mail receipt for airline
tickets.
Your virtual assistant then uses that information to add events to your
calendar, such as “Dinner” at 8:00 pm tomorrow or “flight” with
duration and departure and landing times—even correcting for time zone
changes and including a link in the calendar event to quickly retrieve
the original e-mail.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Microsoft Cortana monitors Windows apps for text that looks like calendar
events. Most intelligent assistants can monitor texts and e-mails for
potential calendar events.
Microsoft Corporation
Connecting Different Data Points Virtual assistants can use
multiple pieces of information to make suggestions to your schedule. For
example, your virtual assistant uses your phone’s GPS, traffic
information on the Internet, and the details on your calendar to remind
you when you need to leave for your next appointment if you want to
arrive there on time.
Security, Settings, and Limitations Although many of these features
are set up by default, you may have to change the security and setting of
your device to allow your virtual assistant access to your e-mails, text
messages, photos, microphone, and GPS location.
Amazon’s Alexa integrates with home automation tools. You can change the
control your personal assistant has—from the ability to read your e-
mails and dim the house lights to simply alerting you to calendar events.
Google, INC.
You may also find that the applications you use do not work well with
your Assistant. For example, Siri only schedules events on the iOS
calendar app, and Google Assistant will only search your e-mails for
calendar events if you are using Google’s email service, Gmail. As a
general rule, assistants only work well with the apps from the same
developer—Siri works with Apple tools, Cortana works with Microsoft
software, and Google Assistant works with Google applications.

utility programs, including a search program, a storage
management program, and a backup program.
Search Most cell phones have hundreds of apps and thousands
of pictures and files. How can you find a particular app or
file you need among all the others? Search programs can
search your device for you to separate what you need from all
the other apps and files. You will find a search program on
mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, as well as
laptops and desktops running Windows and macOS. (See Figure

Storage Management As you use your computer, your hard disk
will fill with photos, videos, documents, and applications.
You may find that as you run out of hard drive space, your
computer slows down. Most operating systems include utilities
to organize and view your hard drive usage to identify old or
unused files. Using these tools, you can move or eliminate
files and give your operating system the space it needs to
run at peak efficiency.

Backup It can be devastating to drop a cell phone or have a
laptop stolen. Not only is the device itself expensive to
replace, but the files and photos on the device may be lost
forever. Backup programs should be run frequently to avoid
the unexpected loss of files from your devices. All major
operating systems offer backup utilities to save a copy of
your device’s data. (See Figure 4-12.)

Figure 4-13.) These suites provide a variety of utilities.
Some programs will improve your computer’s performance,
while other programs will protect your system from dangerous
computer viruses. You can “catch” a computer virus many
ways, including by opening attachments to e-mail messages and
downloading software from the Internet. (We will discuss

Employers generally look for individuals with either an
advanced associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree to
fill computer support specialist positions. Degrees in
information technology or information systems may be
preferred. However, because demand for qualified applicants
is so high, those with practical experience and
certification from a training program increasingly fill
these positions. Employers seek individuals with customer
service experience who demonstrate good analytical,
communication, and people skills.
Computer support specialists can expect to earn an
annual salary of $43,040 to $68,060. Opportunities for
advancement are very good and may involve design and
implementation of new systems.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Making Better Computers by Making Them More Human
Imagine that the next time your computer breaks, instead of getting it
fixed, it heals itself. Many of our greatest technological breakthroughs
are replicating the amazing complexity of nature. Scientists are
continuing to look to nature to bring about the next wave of computing
innovations. These include holding information in the way a brain holds
information, with synapses and nerves to think, remember, and process. In
searching for the next great improvement in computing, scientists are
turning to human biological systems.

Today, most computers automatically perform standard maintenance
operations such as defragging hard disks. Most search for viruses and
eliminate them before they can become a problem. In the future, computers
may not only fix viruses and other software issues, but also identify and
resolve hardware problems using autonomic computing.

Autonomic computing is a computing model that allows machines to run
with little human intervention. It has the potential to revolutionize the
way we interact with computers. The Cloud and Autonomic Computer Center is
the leading research group devoted to developing self-healing computers.
This center includes the National Science Foundation, leading universities
(such as the University of Arizona and Texas Tech University), and
industry leaders (such as Mitsubishi and Dell). Their objective is to free
businesses and individuals from time-consuming computer maintenance by
developing systems that are self-maintaining and virtually invisible to
the user.
Autonomic processes in machines are modeled after human autonomic
processes. For example, each of us has an autonomic system that
automatically controls our breathing, our heart rate, and many other
bodily functions. Scientists hope autonomic computing will behave in a
similar manner and maintain computer systems without human intervention.
Such computers would not have self-awareness but would be self-correcting.
These autonomic computing systems, however, are not artificial
intelligence systems. Although autonomic systems automatically perform
standard operations, they do not have human cognitive abilities or
intelligence. These systems are limited to reacting to their own systems
and have limited capability to learn from experience to correct errors. In
order to adapt to conditions beyond this, scientists have turned to
artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence can be found in computers around the world,
from tiny cell phones to towering mainframes. These programs mimic the
human brain. Researchers at MIT are working on neuromorphic computer
chips. A neuromorphic chip is a computer chip that computes using an
architecture like a brain, with neurons and synapses. They intend to use
resistive computing, a process that uses analog voltages to store and
compute data, instead of the digital method used today that is limited to
binary values. This allows the chip to handle artificial intelligence
tasks much more efficiently than today’s hardware.
Given the potential for a self-maintaining server and a human-like
computer chip, the possibility of a similar system designed for a personal
computer seems less like a dream and more like a reality. What do you
think? Will personal computers ever think and care for themselves?

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Liz, and I’m a computer technician. I’d like to
talk with you about the different types of system units for
personal computers. I’d also like to talk about various
electronic components that make your computer work.”

When choosing a new cell phone, how can you tell which is the more
powerful device? A device’s power lies in its speed, capacity, and
flexibility—all qualities determined by a device’s system unit. Every
computer has a system unit—from cell phones to laptops and desktops. In
learning about the system unit, you will be prepared to make a smart
choice on your next cell phone upgrade, tablet purchase, or even a laptop
or desktop purchase. (The Computer Buyer’s Guide at the end of this book
provides additional information on purchasing the right desktop or laptop
for your needs.)
Sometime you may get the chance to watch when a technician opens up a
personal computer. You will see that it is basically a collection of
electronic circuitry. Although there is no need to understand how all
these components work, it is important to understand the principles. Armed
with this knowledge, you will be able to confidently make sound purchasing
and upgrading decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the functionality of the basic components in the system unit, including
the system board, microprocessor, memory, expansion slots and cards, bus
lines, ports, cables, and power supply units.
System Unit
The system unit, also known as the system chassis, is a
container that houses most of the electronic components that
make up a computer system. Some system units are located in a
separate case, whereas others share a case with other parts
of the computer system.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
As we have previously discussed, a personal computer is
the most widely used type of computer. It is the most
affordable and is designed to be operated directly by an end
user. The five most common types are cell phones, tablets,
laptops, desktops, and wearable computers. Each has a unique
type of system unit.
ethics
Many of the electronic devices purchased in the United States are
manufactured in other countries. Some of these manufacturers pay
extremely low wages, have unsafe or unacceptable work conditions, and
pollute the environment. Do you think that consumers have an ethical
responsibility regarding where and/or how products are manufactured?
Smartphones
As we discussed in Chapter 1, almost everyone has a cell
phone, and almost every cell phone is a smartphone.
Smartphones are the most popular type of personal computer.
They are effectively a thin slab that is almost all monitor,
with the system unit, secondary storage, and all electronic
components located behind the monitor. Designed to
comfortably fit into the palm of one hand and accept finger
touches on the monitor as the primary input, cell phones have
become the indispensable handheld computer. (See Figure 5-1.)

Tablets
Tablets, also known as tablet computers, are very similar to
cell phones, although tablets are larger, heavier, and
generally more powerful. Also, a tablet is not designed to be
used as a phone and, typically, cannot be connected to phone
networks. Tablets come in a range of styles and sizes, with
the smallest tablets (called mini tablets) being just a
little larger than the largest cell phones. (See Figure 5-2.)

Laptops
Like cell phones and tablets, laptops have their system units
housed with selected secondary storage and input devices.
Laptops, however, are larger and more powerful. Their larger
monitor is separate from the rest of the computer and
attached to the system unit with a hinge. Unlike cell phones
and tablets, most laptops do not accept input by touching the
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
screen. Rather, laptops typically use an attached keyboard
and a mouse as the primary input devices.
There are several specialized laptops with features that
make them unique. Some of them are
Two-in-one laptops, which include a touch screen and the
ability to fold flat like a tablet computer. These laptops
offer the advantages of a laptop with the convenience of a
tablet. (See Figure 5-3.)
Gaming laptops, which include high-end graphics hardware
and very fast processors. As laptops have become more
powerful, gaming laptops have become a favorite, primarily
due to their portability. To learn more about specialized
gaming computers, see the Making IT Work for You: Gaming on
pages 112 and 113.
Ultrabooks, also known as ultraportables or mini
notebooks, are lighter and thinner with longer battery life
than most laptops. They accomplish these advantages by
leaving out components such as optical drives and using
energy-efficient microprocessors. (See Figure 5-4.)

Desktops
Desktops are the most powerful type of personal computer.
Like cell phones and tablets, some desktop computers, like
Apple’s iMac, have their monitor and system unit housed
together in the same case. These computers are known as all-
in-one desktops. (See Figure 5-5.)

However, most desktops have their system unit in a
separate case. This case contains the system’s electronic
components and selected secondary storage devices. Input and
output devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, are
located outside the system unit. This type of system unit is
designed to be placed either horizontally or vertically.

GAMING
Would you like to spend less time bored and more time
playing games with friends? Would you like to turn a
simple walk into a sci-fi shoot out or an evening in front
of the TV into an adventure through the Middle Ages? Video
games can turn the mundane into the magical, and with so
many game styles and gaming devices, there is a video game
for every interest and budget.
Mobile Gaming You may already own one of the most popular gaming
devices on the planet—a cell phone. As cell phones have gained powerful
hardware, better screens, and faster Internet connections, they have
become the most popular gaming device. Here are three things you should
know about mobile gaming.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Casual gaming—Mobile games are often designed to be “casual
games,” meaning the games are easy to pick up and play in short
bursts. This is ideal for someone who wants to play for a few minutes
while waiting in line or taking a break from work. Popular examples of
casual gaming are Super Mario Run and Candy Crush.
Augmented reality—More sophisticated mobile games use the mobile
device’s GPS and camera to create “augmented reality” multiplayer
games, where the game’s graphics are a mixture of video images from
the phone’s camera and fantasy elements in the game realm. Examples
of these games are Pokémon Go and Google’s Ingress Prime.
Hidden costs—A final word of caution on mobile games: Many are free
to play, but there may be hidden costs you should be aware of. Some
games require high data usage that can rack up charges on your phone
bill, and some may try to access personal information on your phone
that you don’t intend to share. Be aware of your data usage, read any
fine print, and exercise caution when a game asks for credit card
information or permission to access data on your phone.
Minecraft and other mobile games are designed to take advantage of cell
phone and tablet interfaces.

Console Gaming The most popular video game hardware isn’t a desktop
or laptop computer. It is a specialized computer called a gaming console.
Consoles have specialized hardware that produce high-quality graphics and
sound and are designed to take advantage of TVs and home theaters. They
provide wireless controllers for playing from the living room couch and
HDMI ports to support standard TV resolutions and sound configurations.
Also, because consoles are standardized and popular, they often have
large libraries of games to choose from.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The three most popular consoles are Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox
Series X and S, and the Sony PlayStation 5. If you are looking for an
immersive video game that goes beyond the casual gamer experience,
consoles offer great performance at a reasonable price with excellent
online features and gaming libraries. Here are a few things to consider
when deciding what console to purchase:
Friends—If you want to play online games with your friends, you will
need to get the same console that your friends have. If you want to
play games when friends come over to visit, Nintendo offers many of
the most innovative cooperative games with an emphasis on party games
meant to be played together simultaneously.
Input devices—Each console has its own controllers, with 
different strengths and weaknesses. Nintendo offers motion-
control controllers that use hand gestures to play games, Sony has a
virtual reality headset, and Microsoft has a sophisticated set of
cameras that can record body position and motion.
Games—Although many games are offered across all consoles, some are
exclusive to only one console. Further, each console has types of
games that they are best known for. Nintendo, for example, tends to
attract more casual and family-friendly gamers, whereas the Xbox is
famous for its intense online competition. Look for a console with a
catalog of games that appeal to you.

and popular gaming devices, gaming desktops and laptops offer
unparalleled experiences that attract video games’ biggest fans. Gaming
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
PCs offer the highest degree of customizability, with specialized
graphics cards and input devices. Although an entry-level gaming desktop
isn’t much more expensive than a typical desktop, the price can quickly
escalate as you approach the cutting edge of graphics and sound
technology. Here are some things to consider before buying a gaming PC:
Indy games—Beyond offering the highest-quality video game
experience, gaming PCs also have access to niche and independent
(indy) video game developers, who cannot easily release games on
consoles or mobile devices.
Upgrades—Desktop PCs allow the computer hobbyist to upgrade hardware
as technology improves. Gamers who are willing to open up their
computer and replace parts can keep their gaming PC playing the newest
games without having to buy a whole new computer.
Compatibility—The fact that PC hardware is so customizable can make
it difficult to be sure that the game you purchase is compatible with
your PC configuration. PC gamers must know their system specifications
when buying video games to be sure that the game will run on their
system.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Wearable computers, also known as wearable devices, are one
of the first evolutionary steps to the Internet of Things
(IoT), as discussed in Chapter 2. These devices contain an
embedded computer on a chip that is typically much smaller
and less powerful than a cell phone’s. The most common
wearable computers are smartwatches and activity trackers.
(See Figure 5-7.)
Smartwatches like Apple’s Watch. This device acts as a
watch, fitness monitor, and communication device. For
example, the Apple Watch connects to an iPhone to display
e-mails, text messages, and calendar reminders on the
user’s wrist.
Activity trackers like Garmin Vivoactive 4. This device
monitors daily exercise and sleep patterns. It also
connects wirelessly to desktops, laptops, and smartphones
to record and share data.

System Board
The system board is also known as the mainboard or
motherboard. The system board controls communications for the
entire computer system. All devices and components connect to
the system board, including external devices like keyboards
and monitors and internal components like hard drives drives
and microprocessors. The system board acts as a data path and
traffic monitor, allowing the various components to
communicate efficiently with one another.
For cell phones, tablets, and wearable computers, the
system board is located behind the screen. For laptops and
desktops, the system board is typically located at the bottom
of the system unit or along one side. It is a flat circuit
board covered with a variety of different electronic
components, including sockets, slots, and bus lines. (See
Figure 5-9.)
Sockets provide a connection point for small specialized
electronic parts called chips. Chips consist of tiny
circuit boards etched onto squares of sandlike material

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
called silicon. These circuit boards can be smaller than
the tip of your finger. (See Figure 5-10.) A chip is also
called a silicon chip, semiconductor, or integrated
circuit. Chips typically are mounted onto chip carriers.
(See Figure 5-11.) These carriers plug either directly into
sockets on the system board or onto cards that are then
plugged into slots on the system board. Sockets are used to
connect the system board to a variety of different types of
chips, including the microprocessor and memory chips.
Slots provide a connection point for specialized cards or
circuit boards. These cards provide expansion capability
for a computer system. For example, a wireless networking
card plugs into a slot on the system board to provide a
connection to a local area network.
Connecting lines called bus lines provide pathways that
support communication among the various electronic
components that are either located on the system board or
attached to the system board.

Many electronics contain toxic materials, such as lead, mercury, and
chromium. If not disposed of properly, these materials can leak into
our water supply, get released into our air, or leach into our soil.
First, consider donating them to various charitable organizations that
work with local schools and low-income families. Otherwise, recycling
electronics allows us to get rid of old devices and keep our community

Microprocessor
In most personal computer systems, the central processing
unit (CPU) or processor is contained on a single chip called
the microprocessor. The microprocessor is the “brains” of
the computer system. It has two basic components: the control
unit and the arithmetic-logic unit.
Control unit: The control unit tells the rest of the
computer system how to carry out a program’s instructions.
It directs the movement of electronic signals between
memory, which temporarily holds data, instructions, and
processed information, and the arithmetic-logic unit. It
also directs these control signals between the CPU and
input and output devices.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Arithmetic-logic unit: The arithmetic-logic unit, usually
called the ALU, performs two types of operations:
arithmetic and logical. Arithmetic operations are the
fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Logical operations consist of
comparisons such as whether one item is equal to (=), less
than (<), or greater than (>) the other.
Microprocessor Chips
Microprocessors are an important part of any computing device
and are tailored to the needs of the device it serves. There
are two major categories of microprocessors developed today:
mobile and desktop. Mobile processors are used in cell phones
and tablets and try to strike a balance between the 
processing power of the processor and the power the
processor draws from the mobile device’s battery. See Figure
5-12 for a listing of popular mobile processors. Desktop
processors are used in laptops and desktops. These processors
are less concerned with the energy use of the processor and
are more powerful than mobile processors. See Figure 5-13 for
a listing of popular desktop processors. Chip processing
capacities are often expressed in word sizes. A word is the
number of bits (such as 32 or 64) that can be accessed at one
time by the CPU. The more bits in a word, the more data a
computer can process at one time. Eight bits group together
to form a byte. A 32-bit-word computer can access 4 bytes at
a time. A 64-bit-word computer can access 8 bytes at a time.
Therefore, the computer designed to process 64-bit words has
greater processing capacity. Other factors affect a
computer’s processing capability, including how fast it can
process data and instructions.

The processing speed of a microprocessor is typically
represented by its clock speed, which is related to the
number of times the CPU can fetch and process data or
instructions in a second. Older personal computers typically
process data and instructions in millionths of a second, or
microseconds. Newer personal computers are much faster and
process data and instructions in billionths of a second, or
nanoseconds. Supercomputers, by contrast, operate at speeds
measured in picoseconds—1,000 times as fast as personal
computers. In the near future, we can expect processor speeds
to be 1,000 times faster than that, operating at speeds
measured in femtoseconds. (See Figure 5-14.) Logically, the
higher a microprocessor’s clock speed, the faster the
microprocessor. However, some processors can handle multiple
instructions per cycle or tick of the clock; this means that
clock speed comparisons can only be made between processors
that work the same way.

At one time, personal computers were limited by
microprocessors that could support a single CPU that
controlled operations. These computers were limited to
processing one program at a time. Now, many personal
computers have multicore processors that can provide two or
more separate and independent CPUs. For example, a quad-core
processor could have one core computing a complex Excel
spreadsheet, a second core creating a report using Word, a
third core locating a record using Access, and a fourth core
running a multimedia presentation—all at the same time. More
significantly, however, is the potential for personal
computers to run very large, complex programs that previously
required expensive and specialized hardware.
For multicore processors to be used effectively, computers
must understand how to divide tasks into parts that can be
distributed across each core—an operation called parallel
processing. Operating systems such as Windows 11 and macOS
Big Sur support parallel processing. Software developers use
this technology for a wide range of applications from
scientific programs to sophisticated computer games.
Specialty Processors
In addition to microprocessor chips, a variety of more
specialized processing chips have been developed and are
widely used. For example, many cars have more than 100
separate specialty processors to control nearly everything
from fuel efficiency to satellite entertainment and tracking
systems. Coprocessors, one of the more popular specialty
processors, are specialty chips designed to improve specific
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computing operations. For example, to support fast processing
of virtual environments, a standard feature in gaming 
computers is a graphics coprocessor known as a GPU
(graphics processing unit). These processors are designed to
handle a variety of specialized tasks such as displaying 3D
images and encrypting data. Most cell phones and tablets have
specialty processors to efficiently show and store videos.
privacy
Did you know that one type of specialty processor is devoted
exclusively to protecting your privacy? Called cryptoprocessors, these
microchips perform encoding and decoding of data faster and more
securely than a CPU. These specialized chips exist in ATMs, TV set-top
boxes, and payment terminals.

Memory
Memory is a holding area for data, instructions, and
information. Like microprocessors, memory is contained on
chips connected to the system board. There are three well-
known types of memory chips: random-access memory (RAM),
read-only memory (ROM), and flash memory.
RAM
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Random-access memory (RAM) chips hold the program (sequence
of instructions) and data that the CPU is presently
processing. (See Figure 5-15.) RAM is called temporary or
volatile storage because everything in most types of RAM is
lost as soon as the computer is turned off. It is also lost
if there is a power failure or other disruption of the
electric current going to the computer.
Figure 5-15 RAM chips mounted on circuit board

Cache (pronounced “cash”) memory improves processing by
acting as a temporary high-speed holding area between the
memory and the CPU. The computer detects which information in
RAM is most frequently used and then copies that information
into the cache. When needed, the CPU can quickly access the
information from the cache.
Having enough RAM is important! For example, to use
Windows 11, Microsoft recommends that your computer have at
least 4 GB, or 4 billion bytes, of RAM. Some applications,
such as photo editing software, may require even more.
Fortunately, additional RAM can be added to a computer system
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
by inserting an expansion module called a DIMM (dual in-line
memory module) into the system board. The capacity or amount
of RAM is expressed in bytes. There are three commonly used
units of measurement to describe memory capacity. (See Figure
5-16.)
Unit Capacity
Megabyte 1 million
(MB) bytes
Gigabyte 1 billion
(GB) bytes
Terabyte 1 trillion
(TB) bytes
Petabyte 1
(PB) quadrillionbytes
Figure 5-16 Memory capacity
Even if your computer does not have enough RAM to hold a
program, it might be able to run the program using virtual
memory. With virtual memory, large programs are divided into
parts, and the parts are stored on a secondary device,
usually a hard disk. Each part is then read into RAM only
when needed. In this way, computer systems are able to run
very large programs.
ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) chips have information stored in them
by the manufacturer. Unlike RAM chips, ROM chips are not
volatile and cannot be changed by the user. “Read only”
means that the CPU can read, or retrieve, data and programs
written on the ROM chip. However, the computer cannot write—
encode or change—the information or instructions in ROM.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Not long ago, ROM chips were typically used to contain
almost all the instructions for basic computer operations.
For example, ROM instructions are needed to start a computer,
to access memory, and to handle keyboard input. Recently,
however, flash memory chips have replaced ROM chips for many
applications.
Flash Memory
Flash memory offers a combination of the features of RAM and
ROM. Like RAM, it can be updated to store new information.
Like ROM, it does not lose that information when power to the
computer system is turned off.

Flash memory is used for a wide range of applications. For
example, it is used to store the start-up instructions for a
computer. This information is called the system’s BIOS
(basic input/output system). This information includes the
specifics concerning the amount of RAM and the type of
keyboard, mouse, and secondary storage devices connected to
the system unit. If changes are made to the computer system,
these changes are reflected in flash memory.

memory.

Expansion Cards and Slots
To meet the size constraints of cell phones, tablets, and
laptops, fingernail-size expansion cards known as SD cards
have been developed. These cards plug into expansion slots
located within many cell phones, tablets, and laptops. (See
Figure 5-18.)
Figure 5-18 SD card

As previously mentioned, many personal computers allow
users to expand their systems by providing expansion slots on
the system board. Users can insert optional devices known as
expansion cards into these slots. (See Figure 5-19.) Ports on
the cards allow cables to be connected from the expansion
cards to devices outside the system unit. (See Figure 5-20.)
There are a wide range of different types of expansion cards.
Some of the most commonly used expansion cards are
Graphics cards, which provide high-quality 3D graphics and
animation for games and simulations. While many personal
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computer systems have a GPU connected directly to the
system board, others connect through a graphics card. This
card can contain one or more GPU chips and is standard for
most gaming computers.
Network interface cards (NIC), also known as network
adapter cards, are used to connect a computer to a network.
(See Figure 5-21.) The network allows connected computers
to share data, programs, and hardware. The network 
adapter card connects the system unit to the
network via a network cable.
Wireless network cards allow computers to be connected
without cables. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, wireless
networks in the home are widely used to share a common
Internet connection. Each device on the network is equipped
with a wireless network card that communicates with the
other devices.

Bus Lines
As mentioned earlier, a bus line—also known simply as a bus
—connects the parts of the CPU to each other. Buses also
link the CPU to various other components on the system board.
(See Figure 5-22.) A bus is a pathway for bits representing
data and instructions. The number of bits that can travel
simultaneously down a bus is known as the bus width.
Figure 5-22 Bus is a pathway for bits
raigvi/Shutterstock
A bus is similar to a multilane highway that moves bits
rather than cars from one location to another. The number of
traffic lanes determines the bus width. A highway (bus line)
with more traffic lanes (bus width) can move traffic (data
and instructions) more efficiently. For example, a 64-bit bus
can move twice as much information at a time as a 32-bit bus.
Why should you even care about what a bus line is? Because as
microprocessor chips have changed, so have bus lines. Bus
design or bus architecture is an important factor relating to
the speed and power for a particular computer. Additionally,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
many devices, such as expansion cards, will work with only
one type of bus.
Every computer system has two basic categories of buses.
One category, called system buses, connects the CPU to memory
on the system board. The other category, called expansion
buses, connects the CPU to other components on the system
board, including expansion slots.
Expansion Buses
Computer systems typically have a combination of different
types of expansion buses. The principal types are USB,
FireWire, and PCIe.
Universal serial bus (USB) is widely used today. External
USB devices are connected from one to another or to a
common point or hub and then onto the USB bus. The USB bus
then connects to the PCI bus on the system board. The
current USB standard is USB 3.4.
FireWire buses are similar to USB buses but are more
specialized. They are used primarily to connect audio and
video equipment to the system board.
PCI Express (PCIe) is widely used in many of today’s most
powerful computers. Unlike most other buses that share a
single bus line or path with several devices, the PCIe bus
provides a single dedicated path for each connected device.

Ports
A port is a socket for external devices to connect to the
system unit. A cell phone typically uses a port to recharge
its battery. (See Figure 5-23.) Some ports connect directly
to the system board, while others connect to cards that are
inserted into slots on the system board. Some ports are
standard features of most computer systems, and others are
more specialized. (See Figure 5-24.)

Standard Ports
Most desktop and laptop computers come with a standard set of
ports for connecting peripherals, or external devices, such
as a monitor and keyboard. The most common ports are:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Universal serial bus (USB) ports can be used to connect
several devices to the system unit and are widely used to
connect keyboards, mice, printers, storage devices, and a
variety of specialty devices. A single USB port can be used
to connect many USB devices to the system unit. There are
many types of USB ports.
USB-A is the port found on most laptops and desktops.
USB-B ports are found on peripheral devices, like digital
cameras and cell phones.
USB-C is the newest USB port, found on high-end cell phones
and laptops. USB-C is faster, smaller, and easier to use
than previous USB types. Some USB-C ports also support
Thunderbolt 3, a high-speed version of the USB-C port.
High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ports provide
high-definition video and audio, making it possible to use
a computer as a video jukebox or an HD video recorder.
Ethernet ports are a high-speed networking port that has
become a standard for many of today’s computers. Ethernet
allows you to connect multiple computers for sharing files,
or to a DSL or cable modem for high-speed Internet access.
Specialized Ports
In addition to standard ports, there are numerous specialty
ports. The most common include:
DisplayPorts (DP) are audiovisual ports typically used to
connect large monitors. They are popular on gaming
computers with high-end graphics cards.
DVI (Digital Video Interface) ports connect digital
monitors to your computer. These ports can only send video
signals and cannot send audio signals. They can be found
mainly on desktops.
FireWire ports provide high-speed connections to
specialized FireWire devices such as camcorders and storage

devices.

Cables
Cables are used to connect exterior devices to the system
unit via the ports. One end of the cable is attached to the
device, and the other end has a connector that is attached to
a matching connector on the port. Standard cables include
USB, HDMI, Thunderbolt, and Ethernet. (See Figure 5-25.)

Power Supply
Computers require direct current (DC) to power their
electronic components and to represent data and instructions.
DC power can be provided indirectly by converting alternating
current (AC) from standard wall outlets or directly from
batteries.
Most cell phones and tablets are powered directly from
batteries that are recharged using an AC adapter. These
adapters plug into standard wall outlets and convert AC to
DC. With cell phones and tablets, a USB cable often
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
connects the AC adapter to the mobile device. Some cell
phones, however, can use a wireless charging platform,
eliminating the cable. (See Figure 5-26.) Most tablets,
mobile devices, and wearable computers can operate only
using battery power. Their AC adapters or charging
platforms are only used to recharge batteries.
Like cell phones and tablets, laptops typically use AC
adapters that are located outside the system unit. (See
Figure 5-27.) Unlike cell phones and tablets, these
computers can be operated either using an AC adapter
plugged into a wall outlet or using battery power. Their
batteries typically provide sufficient power for up to
eight hours before they need to be recharged.
Desktop computers have a power supply unit located within
the system unit. (See Figure 5-28.) This unit plugs into a
standard wall outlet, converts AC to DC, and provides the
power to drive all of the system unit components.

Unlike cell phones, tablets, or laptops, desktop computers
do not have batteries and cannot operate unless connected
to a power source.

Does your laptop seem to be losing its charge sooner than it
used to? These batteries do lose power over time; however, you
can take some steps to slow down the aging process.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
1
Balance adapter and battery use. The best practice is to use
the laptop on battery power for a little while without draining it
completely (20 percent charge, for example), followed by charging
it back to 100 percent. Modern batteries should not be drained to
0 percent each day.
2
Calibrate it. Your laptop’s manufacturer will recommend that you
calibrate, or reset, your battery every few months. Follow its
guidelines on the web or in your instruction manual, as it will
ensure that the battery meter in your operating system is accurate
and that you are getting the expected charge time.
3
Avoid excessive heat. High temperatures can accelerate the
deterioration of modern batteries. Therefore, avoid exposure to
excessive heat and consider purchasing a laptop cooler or fan.
4
Proper storage. If you are not going to use your laptop for a few
weeks, most manufacturers recommend that you remove the battery.

Electronic Data and Instructions
Have you ever wondered why it is said that we live in a
digital world? It’s because computers cannot recognize
information the same way you and I can. People follow
instructions and process data using letters, numbers, and
special characters. For example, if we wanted someone to add
the numbers 3 and 5 together and record the answer, we might
say “please add 3 and 5.” The system unit, however, is
electronic circuitry and cannot directly process such a
request.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Our voices create analog, or continuous, signals that vary
to represent different tones, pitches, and volume. Computers,
however, can recognize only digital electronic signals.
Before any processing can occur within the system unit, a
conversion must occur from what we understand to what the
system unit can electronically process.
Numeric Representation
What is the most fundamental statement you can make about
electricity? It is simply this: It can be either on or off.
Indeed, many forms of technology can make use of this two-
state on/off, yes/no, present/absent arrangement. For
instance, a light switch may be on or off, or an electric
circuit open or closed. A specific location on a tape or disk
may have a positive charge or a negative charge. This is the
reason, then, that a two-state or binary system is used to
represent data and instructions.
The decimal system that we are all familiar with has 10
digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The binary system,
however, consists of only two digits—0 and 1. Each 0 or 1 is
called a bit—short for binary digit. In the system unit, the
1 can be represented by a negative charge and the 0 by no
electric charge. In order to represent numbers, letters, and
special characters, bits are combined into groups of eight
called bytes. Whenever you enter a number into a 
computer system, that number must be converted
into a binary number before it can be processed.

cell phone’s battery is the monitor. By reducing screen
brightness, you can greatly extend your battery life.
For Android cell phones: Swipe down from the top of the screen
to display the notification shade and then adjust the
brightness slider (an icon that looks like a sun) to lower your
screen brightness.
For iOS cell phones: Swipe down from the top-right corner of
the screen to display the control center and then adjust the
brightness bar (an icon that looks like a sun) to lower your
screen brightness.
3
Reduce background services. When your battery gets low, you can
set your cell phone to reduce its battery usage by performing
background processes less frequently.
For Android: Swipe down from the top of the screen to display
the notification shade and tap the Battery Saver button.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and choose Battery and tap the Low Power Mode button.
Any number can be expressed as a binary number. Binary
numbers, however, are difficult for humans to work with
because they require so many digits. Instead, binary numbers
are often represented in a format more readable by humans.
The hexadecimal system, or hex, uses 16 digits (0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) to represent binary
numbers. Each hex digit represents four binary digits, and
two hex digits are commonly used together to represent 1 byte
(8 binary digits). (See Figure 5-29.) You may have already
seen hex when selecting a color in a website design or
drawing application, or when entering the password for access
to a wireless network.

Character Encoding
As we’ve seen, computers must represent all numbers with the
binary system internally. What about text? How can a computer
provide representations of the nonnumeric characters we use
to communicate, such as the sentence you are reading now? The
answer is character encoding schemes or standards.
Character encoding standards assign a unique sequence of
bits to each character. Historically, personal computers used
the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) to represent characters, while mainframe
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computers used EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal
Interchange Code). These schemes were quite effective;
however, they are limited. ASCII, for example, only uses 7
bits to represent each character, which means that only 128
total characters could be represented. This was fine for most
characters in the English language but was not large enough
to support other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
These languages have too many characters to be represented by
the 7-bit ASCII code.
The explosion of the Internet and subsequent globalization
of computing have led to a new character encoding called
Unicode. The Unicode standard is the most widely used
character encoding standard and is recognized by virtually
every computer system. The first 128 characters are assigned
the same sequence of bits as ASCII to maintain compatibility
with older ASCII-formatted information. However, Unicode uses
a variable number of bits to represent each character, which
allows non-English characters and special characters to be
represented. Unicode can be written in UTF-16 or UTF-8. UTF-
16 is the older Unicode standard, and each character is a
minimum of 16 bits. The newer standard, UTF-8, can have
characters as small as 8 bits, making it more efficient than
UTF-16.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Brain–Computer Interfaces
Can you imagine a future when we become half human and half machine?
Today, we use computer implants to help people hear and to control their
heartbeat. Computer chips are being implanted into people with
Parkinson’s disease to help them control their movements and to reduce
other impacts of the condition. But these devices are simple compared to
the future of brain–computer interfaces imagined by the researchers and
entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.
The human brain stores information in neurons using electrical
impulses. Using neural imaging, specialized equipment can read the
intensity and location of these impulses or thought patterns. This
technology currently allows amputees to control robotic limbs. This case
and almost all other applications, however, require brain surgery and
cumbersome equipment. Researchers are currently trying to reduce the size
and invasiveness of these technologies. Scientists at Florida
International University are investigating devices so small that they can
travel through the bloodstream to the brain. In the future, a simple shot
may allow your computer to tell what you are thinking.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Elnur/Shutterstock
With improvements in the quality of neural imaging and neural hardware,
we may soon be able to image all the brain’s electrical impulses. For
example, when you think of turning on the house lights, a computer can
take an image of your brain thinking about turning on the house lights.
Later, when you have that thought again, the computer can compare your
brain’s image to previous images and realize that when those areas of the
brain are active, you want the house lights to turn on.
Not only may computers someday read your mind—they someday may write
to it as well. Memories are stored in the electrical impulses of the
brain, and by injecting tiny magnetic particles into the brain, scientists
can stimulate neurons, essentially creating memories. Currently, our
understanding of how the brain operates is too limited, and our ability to
manipulate neurons is too coarse, to allow us to accurately transmit
information. However, someday you may think, “I would like to be able to
speak French,” and through neural stimulation, a computer would generate
the memories necessary for you to speak French.
Many ethicists are concerned by the potential use of such technologies
to improve human abilities instead of treating medical conditions. For
example, with tiny chips being able to store so much, people could use
brain implants to improve their memory. This can lead to a variety of
scenarios where the individual with the implants would have an advantage
over those who don’t have them. However, others disagree, arguing that
the integration of technology and biology is to be expected and it is
nothing more than the next step in human evolution. If such a technology
became widespread and affordable, would you opt to receive a chip implant?

Introduction
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
“Hi,
I’m James, and I’m a technical writer. I’d like to talk
with you about input and output devices … all those devices that
help us to communicate with a computer. I’d also like to talk
about emerging technologies such as virtual reality.”
How do you send instructions and data to the CPU? How do you get
information out? Here we describe one of the most important places where
computers interface with people. We input text, music, and even speech,
but we probably never think about the relationship between what we enter
and what the computer processes. Input devices translate numbers, letters,
special characters, and gestures that people understand into a form that
computers can process.
Tatiana Frank/Shutterstock
Have you ever wondered how information processed by the CPU is
converted into a form that you can use? That is the role of output
devices. While input devices convert what we understand into what the
system unit can process, output devices convert what the system unit has
processed into a form that we can understand. Output devices translate
digital information into letters, numbers, sounds, and images that people
can understand.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to know about
the most commonly used input devices, including touch screens, game
controllers, scanners, digital cameras, voice recognition, and audio-input
devices. Additionally, you need to know about the most commonly used
output devices, including monitors, printers, and audio and video output
devices. You also need to be aware of combination input and output devices
such as multifunctional devices, virtual reality devices, drones, and
robots.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
What Is Input?
Input is any data or instructions entered into a computer. It
can come directly from you or from other sources. You provide
input whenever you use system or application programs. For
example, when sending a text message from a cell phone, you
enter data in the form of numbers and letters and issue
commands such as send message or attach photo. You also can
enter data and issue commands by pointing to items or using
your voice. Other sources of input include scanned or
photographed images.
Input devices are hardware used to translate words,
numbers, sounds, images, and gestures that people understand
into a form that the system unit can process. For example,
when writing an e-mail, you typically use a keyboard to enter
text and a mouse to issue commands. In addition to keyboards
and mice, there are a wide variety of other input devices.
These include pointing, scanning, image capturing, and audio-
input devices.
Keyboard Entry
When you type into your cell phone or laptop, you are using
one of the most common input devices, a keyboard. As
mentioned in Chapter 5, keyboards convert numbers, letters,
and special characters that people understand into electrical
signals. These signals are sent to, and processed by, the
system unit. Most keyboards use an arrangement of keys given
the name QWERTY. This name reflects the keyboard layout by
taking the letters of the first six alphabetic characters
found on the top row of keys displaying letters.
Keyboards
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
There are a wide variety of keyboard designs, from small cell
phone keyboards designed for short messages to desktop
keyboards designed for longer computing sessions. There are
three basic categories of keyboards: virtual, laptop, and
traditional.

Virtual keyboards—these keyboards are used primarily with
cell phones and tablets. Unlike other keyboards, virtual
keyboards do not have physical keys. Rather, the keys are
displayed on a screen and selected by touching their image
on the screen. (See Figure 6-1.)
Laptop keyboards—these keyboards are attached to the
laptop system unit and designed to fold up with the laptop
monitor to easily fit in a backpack or briefcase. Many
high-end tablets offer laptop-like features by including a
laptop keyboard that can be removed from the tablet or
double as a protective case for the tablet. Laptop
keyboards come in a variety of configurations, depending on
manufacturer and the size of the laptop. These keyboards
include all the keys found on a typical virtual keyboard,
as well as extra keys, such as function and navigation
keys. (See Figure 6-2.)
Traditional keyboards—these full-size keyboards are
widely used on desktops and larger computers. The standard
U.S. traditional keyboard has 101 keys, including extra
keys, such as a function keys, navigation keys, and a
numeric keypad. Some traditional keyboards include a few
additional special keys. For example, the Windows keyboard
includes a Windows key to directly access the Start menu.
Some keys, such as the Caps Lock key, are toggle keys.
These keys turn a feature on or off. Others, such as the
Ctrl key, are combination keys, which perform an action

tips
Do you wish your virtual keyboard had the feel and sound of a
physical keyboard? Look for these features in your cell phone
or tablet’s settings to give your virtual keyboard a more
physical presence.
1
The sound of a keyboard—Cell phones can mimic the clicking
noise of a physical keyboard by playing a clicking sound when you
type on the virtual keyboard.
On an iOS device, turn on the system setting “Keyboard
Clicks.”
On an Android device, turn on the system setting “Touch
sounds.”
2
The feel of a keyboard—Cell phones can mimic the sense of
pressing a physical key through a technology called haptics.
Haptics are the use of sound and vibration to simulate a physical
sensation.
On an iOS device, turn on the system setting “System
Haptics.”
On an Android device, turn on the system setting “Vibrate on
touch.”

Pointing Devices
Pointing is one of the most natural of all human gestures.
Pointing devices provide an intuitive interface with the
system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures such
as a finger pointing or moving across a screen and converting
these movements into machine-readable input. There are a wide
variety of pointing devices, including the touch screen,
mouse, and game controller.
Touch Screens
A touch screen allows users to select actions or commands by
touching the screen with a finger or stylus. A stylus is a
penlike device typically used with tablets and mobile
devices. (See Figure 6-4.) Often, a stylus interacts with the
computer through handwriting recognition software.
Handwriting recognition software translates handwritten
notes into a form that the system unit can process.

Multitouch screens can be touched with more than one
finger, which allows for interactions such as rotating

Mice
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the monitor.
The mouse pointer usually appears in the shape of an arrow.
It frequently changes shape, however, depending on the
application. A mouse can have one, two, or more buttons,
which are used to select command options and to control the
mouse pointer on the monitor. Some mice have a wheel button
that can be rotated to scroll through information that is
displayed on the monitor. (See Figure 6-6.)

mouse cord and free up desk space.
community
While the standard input devices work well for many of us, not everyone
has the same physical or motor control abilities. Engineers and
scientists have developed different pointing devices, keyboards, and
even gamepads to make sure that everyone in our communities can write
e-mails, surf the web, and play video games.
These devices vary. Some are designed to be used without using your
hands; others are controlled by your mouth or eyes. Others make it
easier to use your hands with limited mobility, such as gamepads and
joysticks with large programmable buttons.
Have you used an input device designed for improved accessibility, or
seen one used? How can accessible input devices improve someone’s
quality of life and connection with their community?
Like a mouse, a touch pad is used to control the mouse
pointer and to make selections. Unlike a mouse, however, a
touch pad operates by moving or tapping your finger on the
surface of a pad. These devices are widely used instead of a
mouse with laptops and some types of mobile devices. (See
Figure 6-7.)

Game Controllers
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Game controllers are devices that provide input to computer
games. While keyboards and traditional mice can be used as
game controllers, the four most popular and specialized game
controllers are joysticks, gaming mice, gamepads, and motion-
sensing devices. (See Figure 6-8.)

Joysticks control game actions by users varying the
pressure, speed, and direction of a control stick.
Gaming mice are similar to traditional mice with higher
precision, faster responsiveness, and programmable buttons.
Gamepads are designed to be held by two hands and provide a
wide array of inputs, including motion, turning, stopping,
and firing.
Motion-sensing devices control games by user movements.
For example, Nintendo’s Joy-Con controller accepts user
movements to control games on the Nintendo Switch.

Scanning Devices
Scanning devices convert scanned text and images into a form
that the system unit can process. There are five types of
scanning devices: optical scanners, card readers, bar code
readers, RFID readers, and character and mark recognition
devices.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner, also known simply as a scanner, accepts
documents consisting of text and/or images and converts them
to machine-readable form. These devices do not recognize
individual letters or images. Rather, they recognize light,
dark, and colored areas that make up individual letters or
images. Typically, scanned documents are saved in files that
can be further processed, displayed, printed, or stored for
later use.
privacy
Audio inputs have become incredibly common in our devices. With the
increase in smart devices, it can be easy to overlook all the devices
that listen to us for voice commands. While it is well recognized that
cell phones have microphones, many would be surprised to learn that
smart thermostats and smart refrigerators include microphones. One of
the ways that our devices improve their voice recognition is to always
be listening and recording our conversations and to send these
conversations to researchers and scientists for analysis and study.
Privacy advocates are concerned that people who own smart devices may
not realize they are being recorded and studied. Companies and
researchers point out that for a device to respond to our voice, it
must be listening to us and that privacy settings allow users to
customize how much of their information they want to share. How many
microphones are in your home? Are you concerned about how your
conversations might be used by the devices that listen to you?
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
There are four basic types of optical scanners: flatbed,
document, portable, and 3D.
A flatbed scanner is much like a copy machine. The image to
be scanned is placed on a glass surface, and the scanner
records the image.
A document scanner is similar to a flatbed scanner except
that it can quickly scan multipage documents. It
automatically feeds one page of a document at a time
through a scanning surface. (See Figure 6-9.)
A portable scanner is typically a handheld device that
slides across the image, making direct contact.
3D scanners use lasers, cameras, or robotic arms to record
the shape of an object. Unlike 2D scanners, most 3D
scanners cannot recognize light, dark, and colored 
areas. Instead, 3D scanners recognize the shape of
the object they are scanning. (See Figure 6-10.)

Optical scanners are powerful tools for a wide variety of end
users, including graphics and advertising professionals who
scan images and combine them with text.
Card Readers
Nearly everyone uses a credit card, debit card, access
(parking or building) card, and/or some type of
identification card. These cards typically have the user’s
name, some type of identification number, and signature on
the card. Additionally, encoded information is often stored
on the card. Card readers interpret this encoded information.
Although there are several different types, by far the
most common is the magnetic card reader. The encoded
information is stored on a thin magnetic strip located on the
back of the card. When the card is swiped through the
magnetic card reader, the information is read. Many credit
cards, known as chip cards, include additional security in
the form of a microchip embedded in the credit card. This
chip contains encrypted data that makes it nearly impossible
for criminals to forge a duplicate card. Some chips require
that you insert the card into a specialized reader, while
others feature contactless payment, and only require that you
hold the card near the reader. (See Figure 6-11.)

Bar Code Readers
You are probably familiar with bar code readers or scanners
from grocery stores. These devices are either handheld wand
readers or platform scanners. They contain photoelectric
cells that scan or read bar codes, or the vertical zebra-
striped marks printed on product containers. Bar codes can be
found many places, from stickers on fruit to labels on
prescription medicine bottles.
There are a variety of different codes, including UPC and
MaxiCode.
UPCs (Universal Product Codes) are widely used by retail
stores to automate the processes to check out customers, to
change product prices, and to maintain inventory records.
MaxiCode is widely used by the United Parcel Service (UPS)
and others to automate the process of routing packages,
tracking in-transit packages, and locating lost packages.
Cell phones with the appropriate app can also scan codes.
(See Figure 6-12.) For example, after scanning the bar code
from a product you are thinking of buying, the app Price
Check by Amazon will provide in-store and online price
comparisons as well as provide other customer product
reviews.

RFID Readers
RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags are tiny chips
that can be embedded in almost everything. They can be found
in consumer products, driver’s licenses, passports, and any
number of other items. (See Figure 6-13.) These chips contain
electronically stored information that can be read using an
RFID reader located several yards away. They are widely used
to monitor and locate lost pets; to track food from farm to
table; and to record prices, product descriptions, and
locations of retail items.

Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that are
able to recognize special characters and marks. They are
specialty devices that are essential tools for certain
applications. Three types are
Magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR)—used by banks
to automatically read those unusual numbers on the bottom
of checks and deposit slips. A special-purpose machine
known as a reader/sorter reads these numbers and provides
input that allows banks to efficiently maintain customer
account balances.
Optical-character recognition (OCR)—uses special
preprinted characters that can be read by a light source
and changed into machine-readable code. A common OCR device
is the handheld wand reader. (See Figure 6-14.) These are
used in department stores to read retail price tags by
reflecting light on the printed characters.
Optical-mark recognition (OMR)—senses the presence or
absence of a mark, such as a pencil mark. OMR is often used
to score standardized multiple-choice tests.

Image-Capturing Devices
Optical scanners, like traditional copy machines, can make a
copy from an original. For example, an optical scanner can
make a digital copy of a photograph. Image-capturing devices,
on the other hand, create or capture original images. These
devices include digital cameras and webcams.
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras capture images digitally and store the images
on a memory card or in the camera’s memory. Most digital
cameras are also able to record video as well. (See Figure 6-
15.) Originally, digital cameras were only dedicated devices.
Today, many digital cameras are embedded in other devices,

such as cell phones and tablets. Digital cameras provide a
fast and easy way to create photos to share over social media
and e-mail.

Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that capture
images and send them to a computer for broadcast over the
Internet. Webcams are built into most cell phones and
tablets. Desktop and laptop webcams are either built in or
attached to the computer’s monitor. (See Figure 6-16.)
Popular videoconferencing apps, such as Zoom, Microsoft
Teams, and Apple’s FaceTime, use webcams to allow you to
communicate in real time with friends and family using live
video.

ethics
You may have heard of instances where webcams were used to broadcast
the activities of individuals who did not know they were being
recorded. For example, in a famous court case, a university student was
prosecuted for using a webcam on an open laptop to secretly record his
roommate’s intimate activities. In other situations, public webcams
have recorded embarrassing footage of people who were not aware of the
camera. It has been argued that capturing and then broadcasting a
person’s image without his or her knowledge and consent is unethical.

processed by the system unit. By far the most widely used
audio-input device is the microphone. Audio input can take
many forms, including the human voice and music.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound card,
and special software. These systems allow users to operate

computers and other devices, as well as to create documents,
using voice commands. As discussed in Chapter 4, most cell
phones include a virtual assistant that uses voice
recognition to accept voice commands to control operations.
Apple devices come with Siri, Windows devices come with
Cortana, Amazon devices come with Alexa, and Android devices
come with Google Assistant. There are even devices on the
market that exclusively offer access to virtual assistants
with voice recognition, such as Amazon’s Echo, Apple’s
HomePod, and Google’s Home. These voice recognition systems
can perform any number of operations, including scheduling
events on your calendar, composing simple text messages, and
looking up facts on the web. Specialized portable voice
recorders are widely used by doctors, lawyers, and others to
record dictation. These devices are able to record for
several hours before connecting to a computer running voice
recognition software to edit, store, and print the dictated
information. Some systems are even able to translate
dictation from one language to another, such as from English
to Japanese.

What Is Output?
Output is processed data or information. Output typically
takes the form of text, graphics, photos, audio, and/or
video. For example, when you create a presentation using a
presentation graphics program, you typically input text and
graphics. You also could include photographs, voice
narration, and even video. The output would be the completed
presentation.Output
devices are any hardware used to provide or to
create output. They translate information that has been
processed by the system unit into a form that humans can
understand. There are a wide range of output devices. The
most widely used are monitors, printers, and audio-output
devices.
Monitors
The most frequently used output device is the monitor. Also
known as display screens, monitors present visual images of
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
text and graphics. Monitors vary in size, shape, and cost.
Almost all, however, have some basic distinguishing features.
Features
The most important characteristic of a monitor is its
clarity. Clarity refers to the quality and sharpness of the
displayed images. It is a function of several monitor
features, including resolution, dot pitch, contrast ratio,
active display area, and aspect ratio.
Resolution is one of the most important features. Images
are formed on a monitor by a series of dots, or pixels
(picture elements). (See Figure 6-17.) Resolution is
expressed as a grid of these dots or pixels. For example,
many monitors today have a resolution of 1,920 pixel
columns by 1,080 pixel rows for a total of 2,073,600
pixels. The higher a monitor’s resolution (the more
pixels), the clearer the image produced. See Figure 6-18
for the most common monitor resolutions.
Dot (pixel) pitch is the distance between each pixel. The
ideal dot pitch depends on how you use your monitor. Most
newer desktop monitors have a dot pitch below 0.30 mm
(30/100th of a millimeter). Cell phones, which are designed
to be viewed more closely than desktop monitors, can have
dot pitches below 0.05 mm (5/1,000th of a millimeter). The
lower the dot pitch (the shorter the distance between
pixels), the clearer the images.
Contrast ratios indicate a monitor’s ability to display
images. It compares the light intensity of the brightest
white to the darkest black. The higher the ratio, the
better the monitor. Good monitors typically have contrast
ratios above 1,000:1.
Active display area, or size, is measured by the diagonal
length of a monitor’s viewing area. Common sizes are 15,
17, 19, 21, and 24 inches.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Aspect ratio indicates the proportional relationship
between a display’s width and height. Typically, this
relationship is expressed by two numbers separated by a
colon (:). Many older, more square-shaped monitors have a
4:3 aspect ratio. Almost all newer monitors have a 16:9
aspect ratio designed to display widescreen content.

Another important monitor feature is the ability to accept
touch or gesture input such as finger movements, including
swiping, sliding, and pinching. Although most older monitors
do not support touch input, it is becoming a standard feature
of newer monitors.

tips
Do your photos and videos look different depending on what
screen you use? It may be due to different video settings. TV
and computer monitors come from the factory with standard
settings. To get the best performance from a monitor, you
should calibrate the display.
1
Before you calibrate. Many factors can change a monitor’s
response to calibration. To ensure that you have a proper baseline
before fine-tuning your device, consider these factors before
calibration:
Warm up the TV or monitor. Allow the display to warm up for
half an hour before calibration.
Set the display resolution to its default (or native)
resolution.
Calibrate in a room with ambient light. Direct light on the
screen can make it difficult to accurately assess your
display’s picture quality.
2
Select your picture mode. Found within the display or monitor’s
settings, a picture mode is a collection of preset profiles that
adjusts the display to work well with different types of content.
With categories like cinema, sports, games, and dynamic, these
preset configurations change display settings, including color
temperature, brightness, and contrast, to customize the display to
the viewer’s preference. For true color representation, look for
THX or ISF modes; failing that, use cinema or theater mode.
3
Use software tools. To truly maximize your display for its
surrounding environment, you will need to fine-tune its
calibration. For computer monitors, both Windows and macOS come
with free monitor calibration tools in the control panel or system
preferences of your computer. Many TV manufacturers offer free
setup tools as well—check the manual and software that came with
your TV. Finally, you can purchase calibration tools, such as the
THX Tune-up app from THX.
Flat-Panel Monitors

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used type of monitor
today. Compared to other types, they are thinner, are more
portable, and require less power to operate. (See Figure 6-
19.)
Figure 6-19 Flat-panel monitor

Almost all flat-panel displays are backlit, meaning that a
common source of light is dispersed over all the pixels on
the screen. There are three basic types of flat-panel
monitors: LCD, LED, and OLED.
LCD (liquid crystal display) is widely used for older
monitors and is typically less expensive.
LED (light-emitting diode) monitors use similar technology
with a more advanced backlighting technology. They produce
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
better-quality images, are slimmer, and are more
environmentally friendly as they require less power and use
fewer toxic chemicals to manufacture. Most new monitors are
LED.
OLED (organic light-emitting diode) monitors replace the
LED monitor’s backlighting technology with a thin layer of
organic compound that produces light. By eliminating the
backlight, OLED monitors can be even thinner with better
power efficiency and contrast ratios.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books in
electronic format. These books are available from numerous
sources, including many public and private libraries,
bookstore websites, and the cloud. E-book readers (e-
readers) are dedicated mobile devices for storing and
displaying e-books and other electronic media, including
electronic newspapers and magazines.
E-book readers have displays that are typically 6 inches
and use a technology known as e-ink. E-ink produces images
that reflect light like ordinary paper, making the display
easy to read. Two well-known e-book readers are Amazon’s
Kindle and Walmart’s Kobo eReaders (See Figure 6-20.)
Figure 6-20 E-book reader

Tablets can also display e-books. They are larger,
heavier, and more expensive than e-book readers. They are
also much more flexible, with displaying e-books being only
one of their any number of applications. Unlike dedicated e-
book readers, these tablets use LCD displays that provide
crisp, colorful images; however, they are difficult to read
in bright light due to their reflective nature. Two well-
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
known traditional tablets are Apple’s iPad and Samsung’s
Galaxy Tab.

Other Monitors
There are several other types of monitors. Some are used for
more specialized applications, such as making presentations
and watching television.
Digital or interactive whiteboards are specialized devices
with a large display connected to a computer or projector.
The computer’s desktop is displayed on the digital
whiteboard and controlled using a special pen, a finger, or
some other device. Digital whiteboards are widely used in
classrooms and corporate boardrooms. (See Figure 6-21.)
Flexible screens allow digital devices to display images on
nonflat surfaces. Early uses of flexible screens included
cell phones with screens that wrap around the edges of the
phone and curved monitors whose edges wrap toward the
viewer. Recent innovations include foldable screens, such
as the Samsung Galaxy Fold, a cell phone with a screen that
unfolds to become a tablet. (See Figure 6-22.)
Digital projectors project the images from a traditional
monitor onto a screen or wall. This is ideal for
presentations or meetings when several people need to see
the screen at the same time. These projectors can be as
small as a coffee cup and can project images larger than a
standard computer monitor. Unfortunately, projected images
can be difficult to see in bright rooms, so they are best
used in dark rooms with curtains or no windows. (See Figure
6-23.)

Printers
Even as many individuals, schools, and businesses are trying
to go paperless, printers remain one of the most used output
devices. You probably use a printer to print homework
assignments, photographs, and web pages. Printers translate
information that has been processed by the system unit and
present the information on paper.
Features
There are many different types of printers. Almost all,
however, have some basic distinguishing features, including
resolution, color capability, speed, memory, duplex printing,
and connectivity.
Resolution for a printer is similar to monitor resolution.
It is a measure of the clarity of images produced. Printer
resolution, however, is measured in dpi (dots per inch).
(See Figure 6-24.) Most printers designed for personal use
average 1,200 by 4,800 dpi. The higher the dpi, the better
the quality of images produced.
Color capability is provided by most printers today. Users
typically have the option to print either with just black
ink or with color. Because it is more expensive to print in
color, most users select black ink for letters, drafts, and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
homework. The most common black ink selection is grayscale,
in which images are displayed using many shades of gray.
Color is used more selectively for final reports containing
graphics and for photographs.
Speed is measured in the number of pages printed per
minute. Typically, printers for personal use average 15 to
19 pages per minute for single-color (black) output and 5
to 12 pages per minute for color output.
Memory within a printer is used to store printing
instructions and documents waiting to be printed. The more
memory, the faster it will be able to print large
documents.
Duplex printing allows automatic printing on both sides of
a sheet of paper. Although not currently a standard feature
for all printers, it will likely become standard in the
future as a way to reduce paper waste and to protect the
environment.
Connectivity is the ability of the printer to connect to a
network, eliminating the need for a computer to be attached
by a cable to the printer and making it easier for multiple
computers to share one printer. Many printers include the
ability to connect to a network over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface of
paper. This process produces high-quality images in a variety
of colors, making it ideal for printing photos. (See Figure
6-25.) Inkjet printers are relatively inexpensive and are the
most widely used printers. In addition, they are reliable and
quiet. The most costly aspect of inkjet printers is replacing
the ink cartridges. For this reason, most users specify black
ink for the majority of print jobs and use the more expensive
color printing for select applications. Typical inkjet
printers produce 15 to 19 pages per minute of black-only
output and 5 to 12 pages of color output.

Laser Printers
The laser printer uses a technology similar to that used in a
photocopying machine. Laser printers use a laser light beam
to produce images with excellent letter and graphics quality.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
More expensive than inkjet printers, laser printers are
faster and are used in applications requiring high-quality
output.
There are two categories of laser printers. Personal laser
printers are less expensive and are used by a single user.
They typically can print 15 to 17 pages a minute. Shared
laser printers typically support color, are more expensive,
and are used (shared) by a group of users. Shared laser
printers typically print over 50 pages a minute.
3D Printers
3D printers, also known as additive manufacturing, create
three-dimensional shapes by adding very thin layer after
layer of material until the final shape is fully formed. (See
Figure 6-26.) A variety of different processes and materials
can be used to create each layer. One of the most common
extrudes a liquid plastic or other substance through a nozzle
similar to an inkjet printer.
Figure 6-26 3D printer
Solcan Design/Shutterstock
3D printers are controlled by data describing the shape of
the object to be created. This data typically comes from a
file created by a 3D modeling program or from scanning a
physical model using a 3D scanner. Specialized programs then
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
take this data and further process it to create data
describing hundreds or thousands of horizontal layers that,
when placed one on top of another, form the shape of the
intended object. The printer uses this data by extruding a
foundation layer to very exact specifications. Successive
layers are then created and attached to the layer below it
until the product is finalized. The layers are so thin and so
precise that they blend together, making a final product that
shows no sign of the individual layers.
Commercial 3D printers have been used for decades. Their
cost, however, limited them to specialized manufacturing and
research applications. For example, auto manufacturer
Volkswagen uses 3D printers in its production lines to
produce gear knobs and custom tailgate lettering. Recently,
the cost of 3D printers has dropped to as low as $200, making
them available to individuals.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers. These include
cloud printers, thermal printers, and plotters:
Cloud printers are printers connected to the Internet that
provide printing services to others on the Internet. Google
Cloud Print is a service that supports cloud printing. Once
a user activates a printer using the Google Chrome OS, the
user can access that printer anywhere with a cell phone or
any other type of computer that is connected to the
Internet. For example, you could use a cell phone from
almost anywhere to send documents to be printed on a
printer located at your home or school.
Thermal printers use heat elements to produce 
images on heat-sensitive paper. These printers are
widely used with ATMs and gasoline pumps to print receipts.
Plotters are special-purpose printers for producing a wide
range of specialized output. Using output from graphics
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
tablets and other graphical input devices, plotters create
maps, images, and architectural and engineering drawings.
Plotters are typically used by graphic artists, engineers,
and architects to print out designs, sketches, and
drawings.

Audio-Output Devices
Audio-output devices translate audio information from the
computer into sounds that people can understand. The most
widely used audio-output devices are speakers and
headphones. (See Figure 6-27.) These devices connect to a
sound card within the system unit. This connection can be by
cable to an audio jack on the system unit, or the connection
can be wireless. Wireless connections typically use Bluetooth
technology. This type of connection requires special
Bluetooth-enabled speakers and/or headphones. Bluetooth will
be discussed further in Chapter 8. The sound card is used to
capture as well as play back recorded sounds. Audio-output
devices are used to play music, vocalize translations from
one language to another, and communicate information from the
computer system to users. To learn more about headphones, see
the Making IT Work for You: Headphones on pages 150 and 151.

Creating voice output is not anywhere near as difficult as
recognizing and interpreting voice input. In fact, voice
output is quite common. It is used with many cell phones,
cars, and soft drink machines. It is used as a reinforcement
tool for learning, such as to help students study a foreign
language. It also is used in many supermarkets at the
checkout counter to confirm purchases. One of its most
powerful capabilities is to assist people with disabilities.
Combination Input and Output
Devices
Many devices combine input and output capabilities. Sometimes
this is done to save space. Other times it is done for very
specialized applications. Common combination devices include
headsets, multifunctional devices, virtual reality head-
mounted displays and controllers, drones, and robots.
Headsets

Multifunctional Devices
Multifunctional devices (MFD) typically combine the
capabilities of a scanner, printer, fax, and copy machine.
These multifunctional devices offer a cost and space
advantage. Compared to purchasing a scanner, printer, fax,
and copy machine individually, the MFD is less expensive and
takes up less space, but the MFD is also more complex and
more like to break down. Further, a device built for a single
purpose (such as a scanner) is more likely to have
professional-level features and perform faster than an MFD.
The output quality for any one function is often not quite as
good as that of the separate single-purpose devices. The
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
reliability of multifunctional devices suffers because
problems with one of the functional parts can make the entire
device inoperable. Even so, multifunctional devices are
widely used in home and small business offices.
Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays and Controllers
Virtual reality (VR) is an artificial, or simulated, reality
created in 3D by computers. It strives to create a virtual or
immersive experience by using specialized hardware that
includes a head-mounted display and controller. (See Figure
6-29.)

VR head-mounted displays have earphones for immersive
sound, stereoscopic screens to present 3D images, and
gyroscopic sensors to interpret head orientation.
VR controllers have sensors that collect data about your
hand movements. Coupled with software, this interactive
sensory equipment lets you immerse yourself in a computer-

consoles and high-end PCs look to revolutionize the way we
work and play. Virtual reality promises to become commonplace
in the near future.
Drones
Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), were once too
expensive for anything but military budgets. However,
today’s drones are inexpensive, faster, and smarter, making
them a valuable tool and fun high-tech toy. (See Figure 6-
30.) Most drones take input from a controller from either a
radio joystick or a Wi-Fi-connected tablet or laptop. The
drones act as an output device, sending back video and sound
to the user. The resulting combination of video and aerial
maneuverability has made drones a popular choice for a wide
variety of activities ranging from amateur cinematography to
civil engineering. Drone use is on the rise by all types of
users. Drones are used in agriculture to apply pesticides and
monitor livestock, in disaster relief to look for people in
distress, and by the post office to deliver mail.

Making IT work for you
HEADPHONES
For many computer users, headphones have become an
indispensable accessory. From cell phone headsets with
microphones for phone conversations to high-end ergonomic
headphones for extended music listening, there are a lot
of options when choosing the right headphones. Here are
the main features you need to consider when deciding on
what headphones are right for you: style, connection, and
special features.
Style
There are three basic styles of headphones: over-ear, in-ear, and
on-ear.Over-ear
headphones are the largest headphones, with cups that
surround the ear and soft linings to block out external sounds.
The large size of the headphones allows for larger speakers with
greater sound quality. Additionally, the soft linings are
comfortable for long sessions listening to music. However, the
larger size makes them difficult for travel or exercise, and their
ability to block out external noise can cause you to miss
important external sounds, such as an alarm or siren.
Consequently, these headphones are popular with music enthusiasts
and professionals and are primarily used indoors.
In-ear headphones are the smallest of the headphones, with tiny
speakers that insert into the ear canal or rest just outside of
it. These headphones are ideal for travel and exercise as they are
small, are easily packed, and stay in place when walking or
running. However, the smaller size often comes at the cost of
lower sound quality. Like the over-ear headphones, in-ear
headphones block many external sounds—which makes them easier to
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
hear but can be dangerous, especially for pedestrians and people
who exercise outside or near traffic.
On-ear headphones offer a form factor similar to over-ear
headphones, except they do not have a cup that surrounds the ear,
the speaker simply presses against the ear. This allows for more
outside noise to be heard, which (depending on your use) can be
valuable or dangerous. Compared to in-ear headphones, the larger
speakers of on-ear headphones allow for greater volume and sound
quality, at the cost of portability.
Over-ear headphones

Connection
Traditionally, headphones have wires that transmit music from the
digital device to the headphones, but recently wireless headphones
have become very popular.
Wireless headphones use digital compression techniques to send
music from the digital device to the headphones. This can result
in a loss of audio quality. Wireless headphones also need their
own batteries. For small headphones that fit in the ear, the small
size requires small batteries with shorter battery life.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Wired in-ear headphones

Although there are many wireless headphone connection
technologies, the most common is Bluetooth, which is compatible
with most laptops, tablets, and cell phones. Finally, wireless
headphones offer the freedom of not being physically connected to
your digital device; however, the wireless connection is not
perfect. There is a limit to how far you can be from the digital
device, and external factors such as walls and other wireless
signals can cause wireless connections to be interrupted or
dropped.
Special Features
Microphones. Although a strict definition of headphones would only
include audio output devices, many manufacturers sell headphones
with microphones. Even though these are more accurately classified
as a headset, you will often find them advertised as headphones
with a microphone. A headset is particularly useful for making
phone calls, contributing to videoconferences, and playing online
video games.
Water resistance. The small, intricate workings of headphones
are particularly susceptible to water damage. If you expect to be
using headphones in a damp environment or you expect to sweat
while using your headphones, you will want headphones that offer
water resistance. Keep in mind that water-resistant is not
waterproof. Water-resistant headphones can handle being splashed
with water but are not designed to be submerged.
Active noise cancellation. Specialized headphones with unique
hardware can listen to external sounds and produce sound waves
that cancel out these external noises. This active noise
cancellation can make a noisy environment sound quiet. This
feature is often expensive and requires batteries. Nonetheless,
active noise cancellation headphones are popular among travelers
who want to drown out jet engines and road noise. Do not confuse
this feature with noise isolation, which is simply blocking out
sound with foam or padding.

Robots
Like drones, robots have become relatively inexpensive with
expanding capabilities. Robots use cameras, microphones, and
other sensors as inputs. Based on these inputs, robotic
outputs can be as complex as exploring damaged nuclear
reactors to as simple as taking a photo. Recent improvements
in robotics software and decreases in hardware prices have
made robots more prevalent in industrial and hobbyist
workshops. Robots can be found almost everywhere, including
vacuuming floors in homes, assembling cars in factories, and
aiding surgeons in hospitals. (See Figure 6-31.)

Ergonomics
People use computers to enrich their personal and private
lives. There are ways, however, that computers can make
people less productive and even harm their health. Anyone who
frequently uses a computer can be affected. As a result,
there has been great interest in a field known as ergonomics.
Ergonomics (pronounced “er-guh-nom-ix”) is defined as
the study of human factors related to things people use. It
is concerned with fitting the task to the user rather than
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
forcing the user to contort to do the task. For computer
users and manufacturers, this means designing input and
output devices to increase ease of use and to avoid health
risks.
Sitting in front of a screen in awkward positions for long
periods may lead to physical problems such as eyestrain,
headaches, and back pain. Computer users can alleviate these
problems by taking frequent rest breaks and by using well-
designed computer furniture. Some recommendations by
ergonomics experts are illustrated in Figure 6-32.

Description
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Other recommendations to avoid physical discomfort are
Eyestrain and headache: To make the computer easier on the
eyes, take a 15-minute break every hour or two. Keep
everything you’re focusing on at about the same distance.
For example, the computer screen, keyboard, and a document
holder containing your work might be positioned about 20
inches away. Clean the screen of dust from time to time.
Back and neck pain: To help avoid back and neck problems,
make sure your equipment is adjustable. You should be able
to adjust your chair for height and angle, and the chair
should have good back support. The monitor should be at eye
level or slightly below eye level. Use a footrest, if
necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.
Repetitive strain injury: Repetitive strain

injury (RSI) is any injury that is caused by fast,
repetitive work that can generate neck, wrist, hand, and
arm pain. RSI is by far the greatest cause of workplace
illnesses, resulting in compensation claims totaling
billions of dollars and lost productivity every year. One
particular type of RSI, carpal tunnel syndrome, found
among heavy computer users, consists of damage to nerves
and tendons in the hands. Some victims report the pain is
so intense that they cannot open doors or shake hands and
that they require corrective surgery. Ergonomically correct
keyboards have been developed to help prevent injury from
heavy computer use. (See Figure 6-33.) In addition to using
ergonomic keyboards, you should take frequent short rest
breaks and gently massage your hands.

Portable Computers
Although these recommendations apply to all personal
computers, the design of portable computers, including cell
phones, tablets, and laptops, presents some specific
ergonomic challenges.
Cell phones: Today, cell phones are more likely to be used
for texting than talking. As a result, thumbs are often
used to type on a tiny keyboard. The result can be a pain
at the base or in the muscles of the thumb or wrist. This
problem can be minimized by keeping wrists straight (not
bent), head up, and shoulders straight and frequently
resting thumbs by using other fingers.
Tablets: Almost all tablets use a virtual keyboard and are
designed to be held in your hands, flat on a table, or
slightly angled. These design features cause the user to
improperly align his or her head to the viewing surface,
often causing neck and back pain. This problem, sometimes
referred to as tablet hunch, can be minimized by taking
frequent breaks, moving around while working, using a

tablet cover or stand that allows the screen to be tipped
at various angles, and using an external keyboard.
Laptops: Almost all laptops have attached keyboards and
screens. Unfortunately, it is impossible to optimally
position either for safe ergonomic use. When the screen is
positioned appropriately at eye level, the keyboard is too
high. When the keyboard is appropriately positioned, the
screen is too low. To minimize the negative impact, raise
the level of the screen by using books or reams of paper
under the laptop and attach an external keyboard to be used
at waist level.
By using our devices with our ergonomic needs in mind,
we can reduce stress and strain on the body and ensure
our health and comfort into the future.

Careers in IT
“Now
that you’ve learned about input and output devices, I’d
like to tell you about my career as a technical writer.”
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical
reports, and other scientific or technical documents. Most
technical writers work for computer software firms,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
government agencies, or research institutions. They
translate technical information into easily understandable
instructions or summaries. As new technology continues to
develop and expand, the need for technical writers who can
communicate technical expertise to others is expected to
increase.
Technical writing positions typically require an
associate’s or a bachelor’s degree in communications,
journalism, or English and a specialization in, or
familiarity with, a technical field. However, individuals
with strong writing skills sometimes transfer from jobs in
the sciences to positions in technical writing.

Technical writers can expect to earn an annual salary in
the range of $43,000 to $88,000. Advancement opportunities
can be limited within a firm or company, but there are
additional opportunities in consulting.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The Internet of Things
As we have discussed, the Internet of Things (IoT) promises many exciting
innovations. Chances are that you are already surrounded by the first wave
of IoT technology. Your cell phone can monitor and share your location,
your smartwatch counts and can share how many steps you took today, and
your web-connected car can track and share your driving habits. Recent
innovations are just the tip of the iceberg as we grapple with a new world
where everything has a sensor and every action is recorded. Where will
these monitoring tools show up next? What information will they record?
How will that information be used?
In the future, most items will likely include a chip that uniquely
identifies that item and shares that data to applications running on the
Internet. Want to know if that Gucci bag is real or a knock-off? Using the
embedded chip in the bag and connecting through Gucci’s phone app, you
will be able to verify that you are buying the genuine article. Were you
just about to throw that delicate cashmere sweater into the washing
machine on the hot cycle? Not to worry, your smart washer/dryer will be
able to read the sweater’s chip and inform you that you could
accidentally shrink your favorite sweater.
Your clothes aren’t the only items that will be marked with a chip.
The food you purchase will also be uniquely identified. Your refrigerator
will be able to read those chips to tell what food you are eating, how
frequently, which foods are in danger of spoiling, and which foods need to
be replenished. Can’t find the mayonnaise? Your fridge will know where it
is and can guide you to it. Running low on milk? Don’t worry—your fridge
will recognize when it is time to buy milk and will add it to your grocery
list.

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The IoT will extend beyond the home. As you drive to the grocery store
to pick up the milk your refrigerator ordered, cameras on billboards along
the road identify the make and model of your vehicle and tailor their
advertising to your interests. Throughout your shopping trip, cameras are
used to identify your race, gender, and age to highlight products and
information that appeal to your demographic. Your smart grocery cart
accesses your grocery list and guides you around the store, pointing out
sale items and deals. As you pick items up and place them into the cart,
the cart automatically updates your bill. No need to go to the cashier,
just exit the building and your smart grocery cart will charge your credit
card automatically.
Privacy advocates raise concerns related to the IoT. With sensors
recording your location, shopping habits, diet, activity, and even what
you are wearing, companies and governments will have an unprecedented
detailed view of people’s lives. Obviously, this can make shopping
faster, laundry easier, and cooking less hassle, but it can also let
companies know what you eat, what you wear, and how much you spend—
information that you may not want to share. Today, there are concerns
about cell phones and connected televisions having the capabilities to
record your activities in your own home. In the future, as more devices
and products become interconnected, some caution that you may need to
worry about your dinner spying on you and your socks giving away your
secrets!
What do you think? Is the world moments away from Internet-connected
clothing, or is this more science fiction? Are the losses in privacy worth
the gains in convenience?

VISUAL SUMMARY
Input and Output
KEYBOARDS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
AZHANA BINTI ZAINUDDIN/Shutterstock
Input is any data or instructions that are used by a
computer. Input devices translate words, numbers,
sounds, images, and gestures that people understand into
a form that the system unit can process. These include
keyboards and pointing, scanning, image capturing, and
audio-input devices.
Keyboards convert numbers, letters, and special
characters that people understand into electrical
signals. These signals are sent to, and processed by, the
system unit.
Keyboards
There are three basic categories of keyboards: virtual,
laptop, and traditional.
Virtual keyboards are primarily used with cell phones
and tablets. Does not have a physical keyboard. Keys
displayed on screen and selected by touching a key’s
image.
Laptop keyboards are used on laptop computers. Smaller
than traditional keyboard with fewer keys. Includes all
the keys found on virtual keyboard plus extra keys,
such as function and navigation keys.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Traditional keyboards are used on desktop and larger
computers. Standard keyboard has 101 keys. Toggle keys
turn features on and off. Combination keys perform
actions when combinations of keys are held down.
POINTING DEVICES
Bloomicon/Shutterstock
Pointing devices provide an intuitive interface with the
system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures
and converting them into machine-readable input.
Touch Screens
Touch screens allow users to select actions by touching
the screen with a finger or penlike device. A stylus is
a penlike device that uses pressure to draw images on a
screen. Handwriting recognition software translates
handwritten notes into a form that the system unit can
process. Multitouch screens accept multiple-finger
commands.
Mouse
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the
monitor. The mouse pointer usually appears in the shape
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
of an arrow. Some mice have a wheel button that rotates
to scroll through information on the monitor. A cordless
or wireless mouse uses radio waves or infrared light
waves. A touch pad operates by touching or tapping a
surface. It is widely used instead of a mouse with
laptops and some types of mobile devices.
Game Controllers
Game controllers provide input to computer games. Widely
used controllers include gaming mice, joysticks,
gamepads, and motion-sensing devices.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of the most commonly used input and output
devices. These devices are translators for information
into and out of the system unit. Input devices
translate words, sounds, and actions into symbols the
system unit can process. Output devices translate
symbols from the system unit into words, images, and
sounds that people can understand.
SCANNING DEVICES
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Scanning devices move across text and images to convert
them into a form that the system unit can process.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner (scanner) converts documents into
machine-readable form. The four basic types are flatbed,
document, portable, and 3D.
Card Readers
Card readers interpret encoded information located on a
variety of cards. The most common is the magnetic card
reader that reads information from a thin magnetic strip
on the back of a card. Chip cards contain microchips to
encrypt data and improve security.
Bar Code Readers
Bar code readers or scanners (either handheld wand
readers or platform scanners) read bar codes on
products. There are a variety of different codes,
including the UPC and MaxiCode.
RFID Readers
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
RFID readers read RFID (radio-frequency identification)
tags. These tags are widely used for tracking lost pets,
production, and inventory and for recording prices and
product descriptions.
Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that
are able to recognize special characters and marks. Three
types are magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR),
optical-character recognition (OCR), and optical-mark
recognition (OMR).
IMAGE-CAPTURING DEVICES
Stefano Garau/Shutterstock
Image-capturing devices create or capture original
images. These devices include digital cameras and
webcams.
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras record images digitally and store them
on a memory card or in the camera’s memory. Most digital
cameras record video too. Today, many digital cameras are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
embedded in other devices, such as cell phones and
tablets.
Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that
capture images and send them to a computer for broadcast
over the Internet. Webcams are built into many cell
phones and tablets, while others are attached to the
computer monitor.
AUDIO-INPUT DEVICES
Audio-input devices convert sounds into a form that can
be processed by the system unit. By far the most widely
used audio-input device is the microphone.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound
card, and special software. Siri, Cortana, and Google
Assistant are digital assistants that use voice
recognition. Specialized portable voice recorders are
widely used by doctors, lawyers, and others to record
dictation. Some systems are able to translate dictation
from one language to another, such as from English to
Japanese.

MONITORS

Output is processed data or information. Output devices
are hardware used to provide or create output. Monitors
(display screens) are the most-used output device.
Features
Monitor clarity is a function of resolution (matrix of
pixels, or picture elements), dot pitch, contrast
ratio, active display area, and aspect ratio.
Flat-Panel Monitors
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used monitor.
Three basic types are LCD (liquid crystal display), LED
(light-emitting diode), and OLED (organic light-
emitting diode).
E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books
in electronic format. E-book readers (e-readers) store
and display e-books and other electronic media. They use
e-ink technology.
Other Monitors
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Other types of monitors include:
Digital (interactive) whiteboards are specialized
devices with a large display connected to a computer or
projector.
Flexible screens allow digital devices to display
images on nonflat surfaces.
Digital projectors project the images from a
traditional monitor onto a screen or wall.
PRINTERS
Science Photo Library/Alamy Stock Photo
Printers translate information processed by the system
unit and present the information on paper.
Features
Basic features include resolution measured in dpi (dots
per inch), color capability (most common black ink
selection is grayscale), speed, memory, duplex (both
sides of paper) printing, and connectivity.
Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface
of paper. They are the most widely used type of printer,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
reliable, quiet, and inexpensive. The most costly aspect
of inkjet printers is replacing the ink cartridges.
Laser Printers
Laser printers use technology similar to a photocopying
machine. There are two categories: personal and shared.
3D Printers
3D printers (additive manufacturing) create objects by
adding layers of material onto one another. They have
been available for decades; however, recent price
reductions have increased their popularity.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers, including
cloud printers (Google Cloud Print is a cloud printing
service), thermal printers (use heat elements to produce
images on heat-sensitive paper), and plotters (use data
from graphics tablets and other graphical devices).

AUDIO-OUTPUT DEVICES
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
IVAN ROSHCHUPKIN/Shutterstock
Audio-output devices translate audio information from the
computer into sounds that people can understand. The most
widely used are speakers and headphones. These devices
connect either by cable to an audio jack on the system
unit or by a wireless connection. Bluetooth technology
is widely used to connect wireless devices.
COMBINATION INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES
Combination devices combine input and output
capabilities. Devices within this category include:
Headsets combine the functionality of microphones and
headphones; integral part of serious video game
systems.
Multifunctional devices (MFDs) typically combine
capabilities of scanner, printer, fax, and copy
machine.
Virtual reality (VR) creates 3D-simulated immersive
experiences. VR hardware includes head-mounted
displays and controllers.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs) take input
from a controller and send output video and sound to
the user.
Robots use cameras, microphones, and other sensors as
inputs; outputs can be as complex as exploring damaged
nuclear reactors to as simple as taking a photo.
ERGONOMICS

Ergonomics is the study of human factors related to
things people use.
Recommendations
Some recommendations to avoid physical discomfort
associated with heavy computer use:
To avoid eyestrain and headache, take a 15-minute break
every hour, keep everything you’re focusing on at the
same distance, and clean the screen periodically.
To avoid back and neck pain, use adjustable equipment;
adjust chairs for height, angle, and back support;
position monitors at eye level or slightly below. Use a
footrest, if necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.
To avoid repetitive strain injury (RSI) and carpal
tunnel syndrome, use ergonomically correct keyboards;
take frequent, short rest breaks; and gently massage
hands.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Portable Computers
The design of portable computers presents ergonomic
challenges.
Laptops do not allow correct positioning of keyboard
and screen; raise level of laptop and use external
keyboard.
Tablets with virtual keyboards cause improper alignment
of user’s head; take frequent breaks, move while
working, use cover or stand, use external keyboard.
Cell phones require extensive use of thumbs; keep
wrists straight, head up, and shoulders straight and
use other fingers.
CAREERS in IT
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical
reports, and other documents. An associate’s or a
bachelor’s degree in communication, journalism, or
English and a specialization in, or familiarity with, a
technical field are required. Expected salary range is
$43,000 to $88,000.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Nicole, and I’m a disaster recovery specialist. I’d
like to talk with you about secondary storage, one of the most
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
critical parts of any computer system. I’d also like to talk
about various cloud storage services.”
John Fedele/Getty Images
Secondary storage is how we store, protect, and transport our most
important data. Families save precious photos to secondary storage.
Students back up important homework assignments to secondary storage. And
when your cell phone runs out of secondary storage, you can no longer
download new apps or take photos or videos.
Secondary storage devices have always been an indispensable element in
any computer system. They have similarities to output and input devices.
Like output devices, secondary storage devices receive information from
the system unit in the form of the machine language of 0s and 1s. Rather
than translating the information, however, secondary storage devices save
the information in machine language for later use. Like input devices,
secondary storage devices send information to the system unit for
processing. However, the information, because it is already in machine
form, does not need to be translated. It is sent directly to memory (RAM),
where it can be accessed and processed by the CPU.
Understanding the uses and different types of secondary storage will
help you make smart decisions when purchasing a new cell phone or laptop,
help you to protect your data from disaster or theft, and improve the
usefulness of the devices you already own. You need to know the
capabilities, limitations, and uses of hard disks, solid-state drives,
optical discs, cloud storage, and other types of secondary storage.
Additionally, you need to be aware of specialty storage devices for
portable computers and to be knowledgeable about how large organizations
manage their extensive data resources.
Storage
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
An essential feature of every computer is the ability to
save, or store, information. As discussed in Chapter 5,
random-access memory (RAM) holds or stores data and programs
that the CPU is presently processing. Before data can be
processed or a program can be run, it must be in RAM. For
this reason, RAM is sometimes referred to as primary storage.
Unfortunately, most RAM provides only temporary or
volatile storage. That is, if the computer is turned off or
loses power due to a power failure, all the information
stored on RAM is erased. This volatility results in a need
for more permanent or nonvolatile storage for data and
programs. RAM also has the disadvantage of being relatively
small and unable to hold all the videos, photos, and
applications that we regularly use.
Secondary storage provides permanent or nonvolatile
storage with far larger capacity than RAM. Using secondary
storage devices such as a solid-state drive, data and
programs can be retained after the computer has been shut
off. This is accomplished by writing files to and reading
files from secondary storage devices. Writing is the process
of saving information to the secondary storage device.
Reading is the process of accessing information from
secondary storage. The most important characteristics of
secondary storage are:
Media are the physical material that holds the data and
programs.
Capacity measures how much a particular storage medium can
hold.
Storage devices are hardware that reads data and 
programs from storage media. These devices are
typically referred to as drives. Most also write to storage
media.
Access speed measures the amount of time required by the
storage device to retrieve data and programs.

Solid-State Storage
Solid-state storage devices provide access to flash memory,
commonly known as solid-state storage. As we discussed in
Chapter 5, flash memory offers a combination of features of
RAM and ROM. Like RAM, it can be updated, and like ROM it
does not lose information when a computer is turned off.
Flash memory is a little slower than traditional memory but
much faster than other secondary storage drives.
Solid-State Drives

Solid-state drives (SSDs) store and retrieve data and
information much in the same manner as RAM. As we discussed
in Chapter 5, characters are represented by positive (+) and
negative (−) charges using the ASCII, EBCDIC, or Unicode
binary codes. For example, the letter A would require a
series of eight charges. (See Figure 7-2.)
Figure 7-2 Charges representing the letter A
SSDs are fast and durable and require little power, making
them popular for cell phones, tablets, and laptops. SSDs are
common on mobile devices and are gaining popularity on gaming
computers and desktops due to their speed and power
efficiency.
community
Criminals often target communities with malware and viruses by using
infected USB flash drives. These infected drives are handed out for
free at conventions, “accidentally” left behind at the library, or
simply dropped on the ground. When the victim finds the drive and plugs
it into their computer, the drive automatically installs malware and
viruses. Many believe you should never plug in an unknown USB drive.
Others suggest the risks are overblown. What do you think?
These drives can provide internal storage or be located
inside the system unit. (See Figure 7-3.) Or SSDs can provide
external storage.

Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices
widely used in portable devices. Some of the cards are used
within devices such as cell phones, laptops, and GPS
navigation systems. Other cards provide external or removable
storage. Flash memory cards are commonly used with digital
cameras and cell phones to expand their internal storage.

tips
Have you ever accidentally deleted or lost important files from
your flash drive? Do you have a USB flash drive that is no
longer being recognized by your computer? Here are a few
suggestions that might help:
1
Recovery/undelete software. If you accidentally deleted files
from a flash drive, it is unlikely that you can recover them using
your operating system or searching through your recycle bin.
Fortunately, there are several recovery (or undelete) programs
that might help, and some are even free. For example, two free
programs are Disk Drill and Recuva. These programs will scan your
flash drives for deleted files and offer you a chance to recover
the ones you want back.
2
Testing USB ports. If your computer does not recognize your USB
flash drive, there could be a problem with your USB port. Try
plugging another device into that same port to see if it works. If
this device does not work, then your computer’s USB is most
likely defective and needs to be replaced. If the device works,
then most likely your USB flash drive is damaged and you should
try the professional recovery services discussed in the next step.

Professional recovery services. For damaged flash drives, there
is a possibility that your data could be recovered by several

companies that are dedicated to data recovery. Although the fees
are high, they can rescue data from the actual memory chip, even
if the drive or supporting circuits are damaged.
USB Flash Drives
USB flash drives, or simply flash drives, are so compact
that they can be transported on a key ring. These small,
solid-state drives conveniently connect directly to a
computer’s USB port to transfer files and can have
capacities ranging from 1 GB to 2 TB and higher, with a broad
price range to match. (See Figure 7-5.) Due to their
convenient size and large capacities, flash drives have
become a very popular option for transporting data and
information among computers, specialty devices, and the
Internet.

Hard Disks
Unlike solid-state drives, which have no moving parts, hard-
disk drives rotate and have read/write heads that move in and
out. These moving parts allow hard-disk drives to use
inexpensive technology to provide large-capacity storage;
however, they also make hard disks less durable and slower
than solid-state drives.
Hard disks save files by altering the magnetic charges of
the disk’s surface to represent 1s and 0s. Hard disks
retrieve data and programs by reading these charges from the
magnetic disk. Density refers to how tightly these charges
can be packed next to one another on the disk.
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that are stacked
one on top of another. Hard disks store and organize files
using tracks, sectors, and cylinders. Tracks are rings of
concentric circles on the platter. Each track is divided into
invisible wedge-shaped sections called sectors. (See Figure
7-6.) A cylinder runs through each track of a stack of
platters. Cylinders are necessary to differentiate files
stored on the same track and sector of different platters.
When a hard disk is formatted, tracks, sectors, and cylinders
are assigned.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 7-6 Tracks and sectors
There are three basic types of hard disks: internal,
external, and network.
Internal Hard Disks
An internal hard disk is located inside the system unit.
These hard disks are able to store and retrieve large
quantities of information quickly. They are used to store
programs and data files. For example, nearly every personal
computer uses its internal hard disk to store its operating
system and major applications such as Word and Excel.
To ensure adequate performance of your internal hard disk
and the safety of your data, you should perform routine
maintenance and periodically make backup copies of all
important files.
External Hard Disks
Although internal hard disks provide fast access, they have a
fixed amount of storage and cannot be easily removed from the
system unit. External hard disks provide slower access and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
are typically connected to a USB or Thunderbolt port on the
system unit and are easily removed. Like an internal hard
disk, external hard disks have a fixed amount of storage.
However, because each removable hard disk can be easily
replaced by another removable hard disk, a single port on the
system unit can provide access to an unlimited amount of
storage. (See Figure 7-7.)
Figure 7-7 External hard drive
TK 1980/Shutterstock
External hard drives use the same basic technology as
internal hard drives and are used primarily to complement an
internal hard disk. Because they are easily removed, they are
particularly useful to protect or secure sensitive
information. Other uses for external drives include backing
up the contents of the internal hard disk and providing
additional hard-disk capacity.
Network Drives
While internal and external hard-disk drives exist local to
the system unit, either within the system unit or nearby,
network drives place the drive or drives on a network and can
be located across the world from the system unit. This is a
popular solution for individuals and businesses where access
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
speed is not essential, but capacity and durability are
crucial.

Performance Enhancements
Four ways to improve the performance of hard disks are disk
caching, hybrid drives, redundant arrays of inexpensive
disks, and file compression/decompression.
Disk caching improves hard-disk performance by
anticipating data needs. It performs a function similar to
cache memory discussed in Chapter 5. While cache memory
improves processing by acting as a temporary high-speed
holding area between memory and the CPU, disk caching
improves processing by acting as a temporary high-speed
holding area between a secondary storage device and memory.
Disk caching requires a combination of hardware and software.
During idle processing time, frequently used data is
automatically identified and read from the hard disk into the
disk cache. When needed, the data is then accessed directly
from memory. The transfer rate from memory is much faster
than from the hard disk. As a result, overall system
performance is often increased by as much as 30 percent.
privacy
Diminishing secondary storage prices have an unexpected impact on
privacy. The availability of cheap digital storage has resulted in a
permanent digital record of our lives available for all to see on the
Internet. Once an image, video, or message is released on the Internet,
it is very difficult to remove. Some argue that we all have a “right
to be forgotten” and that major Internet companies like Instagram and
Google should help people permanently remove records of embarrassing or
unpleasant moments. Others say that the Internet is a record of our
past and we can’t choose to only hold on to the positive things. What
do you think?
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Hybrid drives are storage drives that contain both solid-
state storage and hard disks in an attempt to gain the speed
and power benefits of SSDs while still having the low cost
and large capacity of hard drives. Typically, these systems
use SSD to store the operating system and applications and
hard disks to store videos, music, and documents.
Redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) improve
performance by expanding external storage, improving access
speed, and providing reliable storage. Several inexpensive
hard-disk drives are connected to one another. These
connections can be by a network or within specialized RAID
devices. (See Figure 7-8.) The connected hard-disk drives are
related or grouped together, and the computer system
interacts with the RAID system as though it were a single
large-capacity hard-disk drive. The result is expanded
storage capability, fast access speed, and high reliability.
For these reasons, RAID is often used by Internet servers and
large organizations.

File compression and file decompression increase storage
capacity by reducing the amount of space required to store
data and programs. File compression is not limited to hard-
disk systems. It is frequently used to compress files on
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
DVDs, CDs, and flash drives as well. File compression also
helps to speed up transmission of files from one computer
system to another. Sending and receiving compressed files
across the Internet is a common activity.
File compression programs scan files for ways to reduce
the amount of required storage. One way is to search for
repeating patterns. The repeating patterns are replaced with
a token, leaving enough tokens so that the original can be
rebuilt or decompressed. These programs often shrink files to
a quarter of their original size.
Windows and Mac operating systems provide compression and
decompression utilities. For more advanced compression
schemes, you can use specialized utilities such as WinZip.
For a summary of performance enhancement techniques, see
Figure 7-9.

List and describe four ways to improve the performance of hard disks.
Optical Discs
Optical discs can hold over 128 GB (gigabytes) of data. (See
Figure 7-10.) That is the equivalent of millions of
typewritten pages or a medium-sized library, all on a single
disc. Most software and many movies are available on optical
discs.
Figure 7-10 Optical disc
limpido/Shutterstock
In optical disc technology, a laser beam alters the
surface of a plastic or metallic disc to represent data.
Unlike hard disks, which use magnetic charges to represent 1s
and 0s, optical discs use reflected light. The 1s and 0s are
represented by flat areas called lands and bumpy areas called
pits on the disc surface. The disc is read by an optical disc
drive using a laser that projects a tiny beam of light on
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
these areas. The amount of reflected light determines whether
the area represents a 1 or a 0.
Like hard disks, optical discs use tracks and sectors to
organize and store files. Unlike the concentric tracks and
wedge-shaped sectors used for hard disks, however, optical
discs typically use a single track that spirals outward from
the center of the disc. This single track is divided into
equal-sized sectors.
The most widely used optical discs are CD, DVD, and Blu-
ray discs.
Compact discs (CDs) were the first widely available optical
format for PC users, but have largely been replaced by DVDs
and Blu-rays. Typically, CD drives store 700 MB (megabytes)
of storage. Optical discs that store music are often CDs.
Digital versatile discs (DVDs) are the standard optical
discs in PCs. DVDs are very similar to CDs except that
typical DVD discs can store 4.7 GB (gigabytes)—seven times
the capacity of CDs. Optical discs that store movies or
software are often DVDs. DVD drives and CD drives look very
similar.
Blu-ray discs (BDs) are the newest form of optical storage
designed to store hi-def (high-definition) video. The name
Blu-ray comes from a special blue-colored laser used to
read the discs that gives them a typical capacity of 50 GB
—10 times the capacity of DVDs. Optical discs that store
hi-def video and the newest video games are often Blu-ray
discs. The newest Blu-ray discs, Ultra HD Blu-rays (UHD
BD), are able to play back 4K video content and store up to
100 GB of data.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats: read
only, write once, and rewritable.
Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs are discs that
cannot be written on or erased by the user. Optical discs
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
that you buy in a store, such as music CDs, DVD movies, and
Blu-ray video games, are often read only.
Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be 
written on once. After that, the disc can be read
many times but cannot be written on or erased. These discs
are ideal for creating permanent archives, such as CD-R,
often used for storing family photos, and DVD-R, often used
to store home movies.
Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random-access
memory) discs are similar to write-once discs except that
the disc surface is not permanently altered when data is
recorded. These changeable, portable storage options are
popular for storing and sharing audio, video, and large
multimedia presentations.

Today’s cloud services allow your cell phone to access
important files from anywhere; however, it can use a lot of
data. Going over your cell phone plan’s data limits can be
expensive and frustrating. Even if you have an unlimited data
plan, if you are a heavy Internet user, your service provider
may slow your Internet connection. If you’d like to reduce
your data usage, consider the following suggestions.
1
Monitor your data usage. Find out what apps are using the most
data by checking your operating system’s data usage statistics.
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen, then choose Wireless & Networks and then Data
Usage. You may need to scroll down to see how much data each
app is using.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and tap on Cellular. You may need to scroll down to see
how much data each app is using.
2
Limit background data use. Many apps will use your data plan
even when the app is not open. Your mobile OS can limit which apps
can use your data in the background.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen, then choose Data Usage and then tap Data Saver.
This will automatically block all apps from downloading data
while active. Finally, select Unrestricted data access and
select any apps you want to allow to use background data.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and choose General and then Background App Refresh. This
lists your apps, and you can select which can use background
data and which cannot.
Some optical discs, referred to as double-sided discs,
contain information on both sides of the disc and need to be
flipped over to read the other side, effectively doubling the
storage capacity of the disk. For example, a double-sided DVD
can store 9.4 GB, or twice as much as a single-sided DVD.
Another way to add capacity to an optical disc is by adding
multiple recording layers. These discs store information on
several layers sandwiched together on one side of the disc.
For example, some Blu-ray discs have multiple layers that
increase storage capacity from 25 GB to 128 GB.

Cloud Storage
Recently, many applications that would have required
installation on your computer to run have moved to the web.
As we discussed in Chapter 2, this is known as cloud
computing, where the Internet acts as a “cloud” of servers
that supply applications to clients as a service rather than
a product. Additionally, these servers provide cloud storage,
also known as online storage.

If you have used Google Drive Docs to create a word
processing document or a spreadsheet, you have already used
cloud computing. (See Figure 7-12.) The service provider’s
server runs the applications, and your computer displays
results. The applications and data can be accessed from any
Internet-ready device. This means that even devices with
little storage, memory, or processing power, such as a cell
phone, can run the same powerful applications as a desktop
computer.

ethics
Cloud storage has created some interesting legal and ethical questions
regarding the storage of sensitive and privileged information. Who is
responsible for maintaining security and privacy of sensitive and
confidential information? What if your attorney or doctor stored
confidential information about you in the cloud and it somehow became
widely distributed across the Internet? Clearly, you suffer any related
consequences, but who is responsible? Is it your attorney, your doctor,
the company providing the cloud service, or do you somehow have the
responsibility to protect personal sensitive information?
The benefits to this arrangement are numerous:
Maintenance—The cloud service will take care of backups,
encryption, and security.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Hardware upgrades—The cloud service will never run out of
disk space and can replace failed hard disks without
interruption to the user.
File syncing and collaboration—Users can share documents,
spreadsheets, and files with others from anywhere with an
Internet connection. One user can sync files across
multiple devices, and all users will have the most recent
version of their documents.
Of course, there are some disadvantages of cloud storage:
Access speed—The data transfer rate is dependent upon the
speed of your Internet connection, which most likely is not
as fast as a user’s internal network.
File security—Users are dependent upon the cloud
service’s security procedures, which may not be as
effective as your own.
Numerous websites provide cloud storage services. (See

Making IT work for you
CLOUD STORAGE
Do you find that you take a lot of photos and videos on
your phone, and your storage space is running low? Are you
working on a group project and finding it difficult to
keep everyone updated with the most recent version of
documents and files? Are you looking for a safe, secure
location to store backups and important files? If so,
cloud storage may be the solution you are looking for.
Here are some things to consider when choosing a cloud
storage option.
What will you store?
The types of files that you store can have a big impact on
determining the best cloud storage service for you. The following
suggests the best file service for you based on the types of files
you typically store.
If you primarily store photos, then consider the cloud services
of Flickr and Adobe Creative Cloud. They feature online tools to
edit, share, and search photos.
If you primarily store music, then consider the cloud services
of Google Play Music and iTunes Match. They feature online tools
to listen to music and create customizable playlists.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If you primarily store documents, then consider the cloud
services Adobe Document Cloud and Microsoft’s One Drive. They
feature online tools to view and edit documents.
If you primarily need storage to back up your system programs,
consider the cloud services of Backblaze and iDrive. They have
apps that back up your devices’ data, making backups seamless
and easy.
Also, what you store will impact how much storage you need.
If you are only looking to store documents and text files, you
will not need much storage space; however, videos and photo
albums can take up a lot more storage. Different services offer
different pricing plans and have special offers depending on
what types of files you store—the best cloud storage plan for
you will tailor itself to your storage needs.

photos.

What tools will you use?
If your storage needs are mostly sharing and working on documents,
your best cloud storage choice may be determined by the software
you use to create those documents. Most office software 
suites are designed to work seamlessly with specific
cloud storage services. Examples of popular office suites and
their corresponding cloud services include:
If you primarily use Microsoft Office applications, then
consider Microsoft OneDrive cloud service.
If you primarily use Google Docs, then consider Google Drive
cloud service.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If you primarily use Apple iWork applications, then consider
Apple iCloud cloud service.

What hardware do you have?
Your hardware choices can influence your best cloud storage
option. Apple’s iCloud works best on Apple devices. Chromebooks
and Android phones are designed around using Google Drive, and
Windows PCs have OneDrive designed into the operating system.
Also, not just the manufacturer of your device, but the type of
device can impact your choice as well. For example, if you do most
of your computing on a mobile device, Google Drive has apps and
tools that are designed to work with touch screens and mobile
Internet connections. However, if you spend most of your time
offline, you may find that Google Drive is not as robust as other
cloud storage options.
How do you want to share?
One of the best features of cloud storage is the ease of sharing
files. Consider who you share with and what you want to share
before choosing a cloud storage provider. For example, if you are
working on a group project at school, and the school uses
Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft OneDrive might be the easiest
solution. If you share files at work, but only want the recipient
to be able to read but not write to a file, you may need the more
robust security features found in a service like box.com. Sharing
photos and videos on Google and Dropbox is easy if the recipient
has a Google or Dropbox account; otherwise, it might take a little
more effort.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Also, consider the technical knowledge of the people you share
with. Some cloud services are designed to be used by businesses
with complex security and backup features. Such features would be
valuable to a company of trained professionals sharing sensitive
documents, but for many less technical people, it is an
unnecessary complication that makes sharing photos and files more
difficult. Apple’s iCloud makes organizing and sharing photos
simple for a typical iPhone user, but that simplicity might be too
limiting for a professional photographer. Facebook may store your
low-resolution photos for free, but if you want to share a photo,
the recipient must sign up for Facebook.
Microsoft OneDrive works well on Windows OS and with Microsoft Office
products.

There are many options in the cloud storage market—finding the right one
for you will require understanding how you want to use cloud storage.
Recognizing the features and limitations of each service is a start to
finding the right place for your family photos or last year’s tax
records. Finally, most services offer a free trial before purchasing or
committing fully—try out a service with different files, on different
devices, and sharing with different people to find out which is best for
you.

Mass Storage Devices
It is natural to think of secondary storage media and devices
as they relate to us as individuals. It may not be as obvious
how important these matters are to organizations. Mass
storage refers to the tremendous amount of secondary storage
required by large organizations.
Mass storage devices are specialized high-capacity
secondary storage devices designed to meet organizational
demands for data storage. These mass storage solutions allow
large corporations and institutions to centralize their
maintenance and security of data, thereby reducing costs and
personnel.
Enterprise Storage System
Most large organizations have established a strategy called
an enterprise storage system to promote efficient and safe
use of data across the networks within their organizations.
(See Figure 7-14.) Some of the mass storage devices that
support this strategy are as follows:
File servers—dedicated computers with very large storage
capacities that provide users access to fast storage and
retrieval of data.
Network attached storage (NAS)—a type of file server
designed for homes and small businesses. NAS is less
expensive, easier to set up, and easier to manage than most
file servers. However, it does not include powerful
management tools and features found in many large-scale
file servers.
RAID systems—larger versions of the specialized 
devices discussed earlier in this chapter that
protect data by constantly making backup copies of files
moving across the organization’s networks.

Storage Area Network
An innovative and growing mass storage technology is storage
area network (SAN) systems. SAN is an architecture to link
remote computer storage devices, such as enterprise storage
systems, to computers such that the devices are as available
as locally attached drives. In a SAN system, the user’s
computer provides the file system for storing data, but the
SAN provides the disk space for data.
The key to a SAN is a high-speed network, connecting
individual computers to mass storage devices. Special file
systems prevent simultaneous users from interfering with each
other. SANs provide the ability to house data in remote
locations and still allow efficient and secure access.

Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for
recovering systems and data after a disaster strikes an
organization. In addition, they often create plans to
prevent and prepare for such disasters. A crucial part of
that plan is to use storage devices and media in order to
ensure that all company data is backed up and, in some
cases, stored off-site.
Employers typically look for candidates with a
bachelor’s or associate’s degree in information systems
or computer science. Experience in this field is usually
required, and additional skills in the areas of networking,
security, and database administration are desirable.
Disaster recovery specialists should possess good
communication skills and be able to handle high-stress
situations.
Disaster recovery specialists can expect to earn an
annual salary of $70,500 to $87,000. Opportunities for
advancement typically include upper-management positions.
With so many types of threats facing organizations, demand
for these types of specialists is expected to grow.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Next-Generation Storage
Every year, cell phones improve. One of their greatest features is the
incredible cameras we can now carry in our pockets. As we record longer
videos at greater quality, we need more secondary storage to hold them.
Scientists are looking to a future where you may carry years, worth of
videos or walk around with an entire copy of the Internet in your pocket
and where every moment of your day will be recorded in vastly larger
secondary storage devices than the ones we have today. Such future storage
will require new ways of thinking and astounding technological
advancements that are currently being studied. In the future, your cell
phone may record data using heat rays, lasers, or even DNA.
Our cell phones, tablets, and laptops have secondary storage that uses
magnets to store information. A magnetic field writes data on the surface
of a magnetized material by flipping a magnetic charge on the surface of
the material. The retained magnetic charge on the surface represents one
bit of information. The magnetic charge on the surface must be kept far
apart from the other bits of information stored elsewhere on the surface.
If the two bits are stored too closely together, the magnetic field of one
bit could overwrite the data in the other bit. This is one of the major
limitations to how much space is required to store information digitally.
Rost9/Shutterstock
To overcome this limitation, scientists are exploring the use of
Samsung’s Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technologies. A HAMR
writes data on a special heat-sensitive magnetic surface. The surface can
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
be written on with a magnetic field—but only when the surface is heated.
When not heated, the surface will not change. Thus, closely packed bits of
information will not overwrite each other as long as the material is not
heated. Writing to the surface is accomplished by preheating an area using
a precision laser. If this technology can be brought to market, a hard
disk could store 50 times more information.
While HAMR technology may allow us to store more information in every
square inch of a magnetic surface, Intel’s Optane flash memory is
exploring the possibility of storing data not on the surface but in 3D
multilevel cells (MLCs). Optane uses flash memory technologies to create
nonvolatile memory stacks that store information both horizontally and
vertically. These dense stacks of bits can be accessed much faster than
traditional flash memory—at speeds rivaling RAM access speeds.
The greatest innovations in secondary storage will likely require a
major change in the way we store data. Many of the most promising and
futuristic secondary storage devices do not use magnets to store
information. In nature, living creatures store genetic information on
strands of sequenced cells, called DNA. In 2017, Columbia University used
encoding techniques developed at Netflix to store 215 petabytes in one
gram of DNA. In 2019, researchers at the University of Washington
automated the read and write processes used to record data on DNA—
bringing the possibility of DNA secondary storage even closer.
Obviously, the technology to read and write DNA data is neither cheap
nor common, but when it comes to storing data, nature has been doing it
longer and better than we have. Perhaps in the future your family photos
won’t be stored on DVDs, but instead on genetic material. Do you think
that the expenses associated with DNA processing will ever reduce enough
to make DNA data storage useful, or will we continue with hard drives and
flash memory?

VISUAL SUMMARY
Secondary Storage
STORAGE

RAM is primary storage. Most RAM is volatile, meaning
that it loses its contents whenever power is disrupted.
Secondary storage provides nonvolatile storage.
Secondary storage retains data and information after the
computer system is turned off.
Writing is the process of saving information to
secondary storage devices (drives). Reading is the
process of accessing information.
Important characteristics include the following:
Media—actual physical material that retains data and
programs.
Capacity—how much a particular storage medium can
hold.
Storage devices—hardware that reads and writes to
storage media.
Access speed—time required to retrieve data from a
secondary storage device.
SOLID-STATE STORAGE
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Solid-state storage devices provide access to flash
memory, also know as solid-state storage. Flash memory
is slower than traditional memory but faster than other
secondary storage drives. Solid-state storage devices
have no moving parts and provide access to flash memory
(solid-state storage).
Solid-State Drives
Solid-state drives (SSDs) work much like RAM. They are
fast and durable, require little power, are relatively
expensive, and are lower in capacity than other secondary
storage drives. SSDs can provide internal storage or can
be located outside the system unit.
Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices
that are widely used with portable devices including
digital cameras, cell phones, and navigation systems.
USB Flash Drives
USB flash drives (flash drives) are so small that they
fit onto a key ring. These drives connect to a
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computer’s USB port and are widely used to transfer data
and information between computers, specialty devices, and
the Internet.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of the different types of secondary
storage. You need to know their capabilities,
limitations, and uses. There are four widely used
storage media: hard disk, solid state, optical disc,
and cloud storage.
HARD DISKS
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that provide a
large amount of capacity. They store data and programs by
altering the electromagnetic charges on the platter’s
surface. Files are organized according to
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Tracks—concentric rings on the platter.
Sectors—wedge-shaped sections.
Cylinders—run through each track of a stack of
platters.
Density refers to how tightly electromagnetic charges
can be packed next to one another on the disk.
Internal Hard Disks
Internal hard disks are located within the system unit.
They are used to store programs and data files.
External Hard Disks
External hard-disk drives connect to a port on the system
unit, are not as fast as internal drives, and are
removable, providing unlimited storage using a single
port.
HARD DISKS

Network Drives
Network drives are located on a network anywhere in the
world.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Performance Enhancements
Four ways to improve hard-disk performance are disk
caching, hybrid drives, RAID, and file compression and
decompression.
Disk caching—provides a temporary high-speed holding
area between a secondary storage device and the CPU;
improves performance by anticipating data needs and
reducing time to access data from secondary storage.
Hybrid drives—contain both solid-state storage and
hard disks in an attempt to gain the speed and power
benefits of SSDs while still having the low cost and
large capacity of hard drives.
RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks)—several
inexpensive hard-disk drives are connected together;
improves performance by providing expanded storage,
fast access, and high reliability.
File compression and decompression—files are
compressed before storing and then decompressed before
being used again; improves performance through
efficient storage.

OPTICAL DISCS

Optical discs use laser technology. 1s and 0s are
represented by pits and lands. Optical disc drives
project light and measure the reflected light.
The most widely used optical discs are the following:
Compact discs (CDs) were the first; typical storage
700 MB; often used to store music.
Digital versatile discs (DVDs) are standard optical
discs; typical storage 4.7 GB; often used to store
movies and software.
Blu-ray discs (BDs) are designed to store hi-def
(high-definition) video; typical storage 50 GB; often
used to store hi-def video and video games; Ultra HD
Blu-rays (UHD BD) are the newest and able to use 4K
video content and store up to 100 GB of data.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats:
Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs cannot be
written on or erased by the user.
Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be written on
once. After that, they can be read many times but
cannot be written on or erased.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random-
access memory) discs are similar to write-once discs
except that the disc surface is not permanently altered
when data is recorded.
CLOUD STORAGE
Nopparat Khokthong/Shutterstock
With cloud computing, the Internet acts as a “cloud”
of servers. Cloud storage (online storage) is supplied
by these servers.
Cloud servers provide storage, processing, and memory.
Advantages for users include less maintenance, fewer
hardware upgrades, and easy file sharing and
collaboration.
Disadvantages for users include slower access speed and
less control over file security.
MASS STORAGE DEVICES
Mass storage refers to the tremendous amount of
secondary storage required by large organizations. Mass
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
storage devices are specialized high-capacity secondary
storage devices.
Most large organizations have established a strategy
called an enterprise storage system to promote efficient
and safe use of data.
Mass storage devices that support this strategy are
file servers, network attached storage (NAS), RAID
systems, and organizational cloud storage. A storage
area network (SAN) is a method of using enterprise-level
remote storage systems as if they were local to your
computer.
CAREERS in IT
Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for
recovering systems and data after a disaster strikes an
organization. Bachelor’s or associate’s degree in
information systems or computer science, experience, and
additional skills in the areas of networking, security,
and database administration are desirable. Expected
salary range is $70,500 to $87,000.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Michael, and I’m a network administrator. I’d like
to talk with you about computer communications and networks. I’d
also like to talk about technologies that support mobile computing
including global positioning systems, Wi-Fi, and 4G and 5G
networks.”
At one time, network-connected computers were only found at the largest
businesses and universities. Today, with cell phones, we carry network-
connected computers in our pockets. Smart appliances in your kitchen mean
your refrigerator may be connected to the Internet. The Internet of Things
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
means your watch or your thermostat may be using networks to communicate.
The communications and information options we have at our fingertips have
changed how we react and relate to the world around us.
Scharfsinn/Shutterstock
As the power and flexibility of our communication systems have
expanded, the sophistication of the networks that support these systems
has become increasingly critical and complex. The network technologies
that handle our cellular, business, and Internet communications come in
many different forms. Satellites, broadcast towers, telephone lines, even
buried cables and fiber optics carry our telephone messages, e-mail, and
text messages. These different networks must be able to efficiently and
effectively integrate with one another.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the concept of connectivity, wireless networking, and the elements that
make up network and communications systems. Additionally, you need to
understand the basics of communications channels, connection devices, data
transmission, network types, network architectures, and organizational
networks.
Communications
Computer communications is the process of sharing data,
programs, and information between two or more computers. We
have discussed numerous applications that depend on
communication systems to share data among devices, including
Texting—provides very efficient direct text communication
between individuals using short electronic messages.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
E-mail—provides a fast, efficient alternative to
traditional mail by sending and receiving electronic
documents.
Videoconferencing—provides an alternative to meeting in
person using audio communications (such as a phone call)
often with video to see the people you talk to.
Electronic commerce—buying and selling goods
electronically.
In this chapter, we will focus on the communication
systems that support these and many other applications.
Connectivity, the wireless revolution, and communication
systems are key concepts and technologies for the 21st
century.
Connectivity
Connectivity is a concept related to using computer networks
to link people and resources. For example, connectivity means
that you can connect your cell phone to other devices and
information sources from almost anywhere. With this
connection, you are linked to the world of larger computers
and the Internet. This includes hundreds of thousands of web
servers and their extensive information resources. Thus,
being able to efficiently and effectively use computers
becomes a matter of knowing not only about connectivity
through networks to cell phones, but also about larger
computer systems and their information resources.

The Wireless Revolution
The single most dramatic change in connectivity and
communications since the development of the Internet has been
the widespread use of mobile devices like cell phones and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
tablets with fast wireless Internet connectivity. Students,
parents, teachers, businesspeople, and others routinely talk
and communicate with these devices. It is estimated that over
4.6 billion cell phones are in use worldwide. This wireless
technology allows individuals to stay connected with one
another from almost anywhere at any time.
So what’s the revolution? Although wireless technology
was originally used primarily for voice communications,
today’s mobile computers support e-mail, web access, social
networking, and a variety of Internet applications. In
addition, wireless technology allows a wide variety of nearby
devices to communicate with one another without any physical
connection. Wireless communications allows you to share a
high-speed printer, share data files, and collaborate on
working documents with a nearby co-worker without having your
computers connected by cables or telephone. High-speed
Internet wireless technology allows individuals to connect to
the Internet and share information from almost anywhere in
the world. (See Figure 8-1.) The revolution has just begun,
and where it goes from here will be decided by you and others
who understand the power of communication systems.

Communication Systems
Communication systems are electronic systems that transmit
data from one location to another. Whether wired or wireless,
every communication system has four basic elements. (See
Figure 8-2.)
Sending and receiving devices. These are often a computer
or specialized communication device. They originate (send)
as well as accept (receive) messages in the form of data,
information, and/or instructions.
Connection devices. These devices act as an interface
between the sending and receiving devices and the
communication channel. They convert outgoing messages into
packets that can travel across the communication channel.
They also reverse the process for incoming messages.
Data transmission specifications. These are rules 
and procedures that coordinate the sending and
receiving devices by precisely defining how the message
will be sent across the communication channel.
Communication channel. This is the actual connecting or
transmission medium that carries the message. This medium
can be a physical wire or cable, or it can be wireless.

Description
For example, if you wanted to send an e-mail to a friend,
you could create and send the message using your cell phone,
the sending device. Your modem is on a microchip located
inside your cell phone. It functions as the connection device
that would modify and format the message so that it could
travel efficiently across communication channels, such as
cell phone towers. The specifics describing how the message
is modified, reformatted, and sent would be described in the
data transmission specifications. After your message traveled
across the channel, a connection device, such as a modem
connected to a desktop computer, would reformat it so that it
could be displayed on your friend’s computer, the receiving
device. (Note: This example presents the basic communication
system elements involved in sending e-mail. It does not and
is not intended to demonstrate all the specific steps and
equipment involved in an e-mail delivery system.)
ethics
As eavesdropping tools become more sophisticated, there is concern that
law enforcement and government agencies will monitor everyone’s
Internet and cell phone activity. In the private sector, companies are
increasingly using network tools and software to monitor the activity
of their employees. Many websites also track your activity, and
government officials have often requested these records during the
course of an investigation. Some believe that it is unethical for
government and businesses to engage in such monitoring and tracking. Do
you agree?

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Describe the four elements of every communication system.
Communication Channels
Communication channels are an essential element of every
communication system. These channels actually carry the data
from one computer to another. There are two categories of
communciation channels, wireless and wired. Wireless
communications send information through the air, such as when
you use a cell phone. Wired communications require a physical
connection and are more common with desktop computers.
Wireless Connections
Wireless connections do not use a solid substance to connect
sending and receiving devices. Rather, they move data through
the air.
Most wireless connections use radio waves to communicate.
For example, cell phones and many other Internet-enabled
devices use radio waves to place telephone calls and to
connect to the Internet. Primary technologies used for
wireless connections are cellular, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
microwave, WiMax, and satellite connections.
Cellular communication uses multiple antennae (cell
towers) to send and receive data within relatively small
geographic regions (cells). Most cell phones and other
mobile devices use cellular networks.
Bluetooth is a short-range radio communication standard
that transmits data over short distances of up to
approximately 33 feet. Bluetooth is widely used for
wireless headsets, printer connections, and handheld
devices.
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) uses high-frequency radio
signals to transmit data. A number of standards for Wi-Fi
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
exist, and each can send and receive data at a different
speed. (See Figure 8-3.) Most home and business wireless
networks use Wi-Fi.
Microwave communication uses high-frequency radio waves. It
is sometimes referred to as line-of-sight communication
because microwaves can only travel in a straight 
line. Because the waves cannot bend with the
curvature of the earth, they can be transmitted only over
relatively short distances. Thus, microwave is a good
medium for sending data between buildings in a city or on a
large college campus. For longer distances, the waves must
be relayed by means of microwave stations with microwave
dishes or antennas. (See Figure 8-4.)
WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)
is a wireless standard that extends the range of Wi-Fi
networks using microwave connections. WiMax is commonly
used by universities and others to extend the capability of
existing Wi-Fi networks.
Satellite communication uses satellites orbiting about
22,000 miles above the earth as microwave relay stations.
Many of these are offered by Intelsat, the International
Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, which is owned by
114 governments and forms a worldwide communication system.
Satellites orbit at a precise point and speed above the
earth. They can amplify and relay microwave signals from
one transmitter on the ground to another. Satellites can be
used to send and receive large volumes of data. Uplink is a
term relating to sending data to a satellite. Downlink
refers to receiving data from a satellite. The major
drawback to satellite communication is that bad weather can
sometimes interrupt the flow of data.
One of the most interesting applications of satellite
communications is for global positioning. A network of
satellites owned and managed by the Department of Defense
continuously sends location information to earth. Global
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
positioning system (GPS) devices use that information to
uniquely determine the geographic location of the device.
Available in many automobiles to provide navigational
support, these systems are often mounted into the dash with
a monitor to display maps and speakers to provide spoken
directions. Most of today’s cell phones and tablets use
GPS technology for handheld navigation. (See Figure 8-5.)

Unlike radio waves, infrared uses infrared light waves to
communicate over short distances. Like microwave
transmissions, infrared is a line-of-sight communication.
Because light waves can only travel in a straight line,
sending and receiving devices must be in clear view of one
another without any obstructions blocking that view. One of
the most common infrared devices is the TV remote control.
community
Much of the developing world does not have access to the Internet.
Amazon’s Project Kuiper looks to change that by launching a network of
over 3,000 low-orbit satellites to provide Internet to the unserved and
underserved communities of the world. Proponents of the network suggest
that the citizens of developing nations will be greatly benefited by
the essential services that the Internet can provide, such as education
and health care. Opponents point out that the majority of developing
nation citizens cannot afford the devices necessary to connect to the
Internet. What do you think? Will bringing the Internet to developing
countries help the average citizen, or will this only benefit the
wealthiest in these countries?
Physical Connections
Physical connections use a solid medium to connect sending
and receiving devices. These connections include twisted-
pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cables.
Fiber-optic cable transmits data as pulses of light through
tiny tubes of glass. (See Figure 8-6.) The data
transmission speeds of fiber-optic cables are incredible;
recently, speeds of 1 petabit per second were measured (a
petabit is 1 million gigabits). Compared to coaxial cable,
it is lighter, faster, and more reliable at transmitting
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
data. Fiber-optic cable is rapidly replacing twisted-pair
cable telephone lines.
Coaxial cable, a high-frequency transmission cable,
replaces the multiple wires of telephone lines with a
single solid-copper core. (See Figure 8-7.) In terms of the
number of telephone connections, a coaxial cable has over
80 times the transmission capacity of twisted pair. Coaxial
cable is used to deliver television signals as well as to
connect computers in a network.
Twisted-pair cable consists of pairs of copper wire that

Ethernet cables use twisted pair. (See Figure 8-8.)
Ethernet cables are often used in networks and to connect a
variety of components to the system unit.

Connection Devices
At one time nearly all computer communication used telephone
lines. However, because the telephone was originally designed
for voice transmission, telephone lines were designed to
carry analog signals, which are continuous electronic waves.
Computers, in contrast, send and receive digital signals.
(See Figure 8-9.) These represent the presence or absence of
an electronic pulse—the binary signals of 1s and 0s we
mentioned in Chapter 5. To convert the digital signals to
analog signals and vice versa, you need a modem.

Modems
The word modem is short for modulator-demodulator. Modulation
is the name of the process of converting from digital to
analog. Demodulation is the process of converting from analog
to digital. The modem enables digital personal computers to
communicate across different media, including telephone
wires, cable lines, and radio waves.
The speed with which modems transmit data varies. This
speed, called transfer rate, is typically measured in
millions of bits (megabits) per second (Mbps). (See Figure
8-10.) The higher the speed, the faster you can send and
receive information. For example, to download a complete
full-length motion picture (700 MB) on a 1.5-Mbps modem would
take about 1 hour. Using a 10.0-Mbps modem would take about 9
minutes.
Unit Speed
Mbps Million bits per second
Gbps Billion bits per second
Tbps Trillion bits per second
Figure 8-10 Typical transfer rates
There are three commonly used types of modems: DSL, cable,
and wireless. (See Figure 8-11.)
A DSL (digital subscriber line) modem uses standard phone
lines to create a high-speed connection directly to your
phone company’s offices. These devices are usually
external and connect to the system unit using either a USB
or an Ethernet port.
A cable modem uses the same coaxial cable as your
television. Like a DSL modem, a cable modem creates high-

speed connections using the system unit’s USB or Ethernet
port.
A wireless modem is also known as a WWAN (wireless wide
area network) modem. Almost all computers today have built-
in wireless modems. For those that do not, wireless adapter
cards are available that plug into USB or special card
ports.

Is 5G right for you? What are the reasons to upgrade? There are
a few factors to consider.
1
Is 5G available in your area? If you live and work in an area
where a 5G network is unavailable, a 5G phone will not improve
your cell phone experience. On the other hand, if your area has
strong 5G coverage, you may want to upgrade to a 5G phone to take
advantage of faster network speeds. Check with your cell phone
provider to find out what is available in your area.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
2
How do you use the Internet on your phone? If you are using
your cell phone Internet connection mostly for browsing the web
and answering e-mails, a faster Internet connection may not offer
much of an improvement. However, if you are doing data-intensive
tasks—like streaming videos, videoconferencing, and playing games
over the Internet—you may want to consider upgrading to 5G.
3
Does your cellular service provider offer home Internet? 5G
networks have Internet speeds that rival the speeds of traditional
Internet service providers (ISPs). Some cellular service providers
are offering 5G services that will replace your home ISP with
competitive rates and bundling options. Contact your cellular
service provider to see if this is an option for you!
Connection Service
For years, large corporations have been leasing special high-
speed lines from telephone companies. Originally, these were
copper lines, known as T1 lines, that could be combined to
form higher-capacity options known as T3 or DS3 lines. These
lines have largely been replaced by faster optical carrier
(OC) lines.
Although the special high-speed lines are too costly for
most individuals, Internet service providers (as discussed in
Chapter 2) do provide affordable connections. For years,
individuals relied on dial-up services using existing
telephones and telephone modems to connect to the Internet.
This type of service has been replaced by higher-speed
connection services, including cellular, DSL, cable, and
satellite services.
Cellular service providers, including Verizon, AT&T,
Sprint, and T-Mobile, support voice and data transmission
to wireless devices using cellular networks. The progress
of mobile telecommunication is measured in generations. The
first generation (1G) started in the 1980s and has
progressed to today’s fifth generation (5G):
First generation (1G) could only transmit analog signals
used for voice communications.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Second generation (2G) used radio signals for cellular
calls and introduced texting.
Third generation (3G) improved data speeds and
introduced widespread use of the Internet on cell phones.
Fourth generation (4G) uses Long Term Evolution (LTE)
connections for increased Internet speeds, making
streaming videos and music popular on cell phones.
Fifth generation (5G) is the newest and fastest network,
with speeds rivaling home Internet connections. The 5G
network is a new technology and may not be available yet
in your area as service providers update old antennae and
add new antennae to the network.
Digital subscriber line (DSL) service is provided by
telephone companies using existing telephone lines to
provide high-speed connections. ADSL (asymmetric digital
subscriber line) is one of the most widely used types of
DSL. DSL is much faster than dial-up.
Cable service is provided by cable television companies
using their existing television cables. These connections
are usually faster than DSL.
Fiber-optic service (FiOS) is showing up in some areas,
but it is a new technology and not widely available.
Current providers of FiOS include Google and Verizon with
speeds faster than cable or DSL connections.
Satellite connection services use satellites to provide
wireless connections. Although slower than DSL and cable
modem, satellite connections are available almost anywhere
using a satellite-receiving disk.

THE MOBILE OFFICE
With the proper devices and software, you can take your
work away from the office and move your studies outside
the classroom. Mobile tools can allow you to set up an
effective workspace at a coffee shop, in an airport, or at
the kitchen table. A mobile office gives you the
flexibility to get work done whenever you have a spare
moment, wherever you may be.
Two of the most important features of the mobile office
are your Internet connection when on the go and the tools
to replicate the resources of working in person. For
accessing the Internet, there are three popular options:
mobile hotspot devices, personal hotspots, and public Wi-
Fi.
Mobile Hotspot Device
Many cell phone service providers offer stand-alone devices that
connect to a 4G or 5G network and allow multiple devices near it
to access the Internet via Wi-Fi connection. Most home office
setups use a lot of data on your data connection. When choosing a
hotspot device from a cell phone service provider, consider the
provider’s data options and pricing.

Personal Hotspot
Many cell phones can act as mobile hotspot devices, allowing
nearby tablets and laptops to connect to the Internet. Sometimes
called tethering, devices can connect to the cell phone via
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or USB cable and, through that connection,
access the Internet. Personal hotspots offer a simple mobile
Internet solution without the additional cost of purchasing a
mobile hotspot device. Unfortunately, using a personal hotspot
will drain your cell phone’s battery more quickly, will increase
your phone’s data plan usage, and may require some extra effort
to set up. Contact your cell phone provider to learn about the
costs and processes associated with setting up a personal hotspot.

Public Wi-Fi
Even if you can’t use the Internet on the go—you can probably get
online when you arrive. Many public locations, especially
airports, hotels, and coffee shops, offer free or low-cost
Internet connections. Not all pubic Wi-Fi Internet connections are
safe. Only connect to networks that are offered from locations you
trust.

An Internet connection is valueless if you do’t have the right software
to take advantage of it. The two most common mobile office tools are
cloud storage to have access to your files from anywhere and
videoconferencing software to communicate and collaborate with your
teammates.
Cloud Storage
When on the go, you want your documents to be available, up to
date, and secure. With an Internet connection, you can connect to
cloud storage services that will hold your important documents.
Through cloud storage, you can collaborate with co-workers and
always be confident you have the most up-to-date version of the
document. Further, if you lose or damage your laptop, your
documents are stored in the cloud and will not be lost. Finally,
cloud storage synchs across multiple devices, so you can review a
spreadsheet on your cell phones, make changes on your laptop, and
then share it with co-workers on your tablet. Popular cloud
services are Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox.

Videoconferencing
Videoconferencing can allow you to have a face-to-face meeting
without being in the same room—or even the same country. A
camera, microphone, and speakers will be needed to videoconference
—most cell phones, tablets, and laptops come with these
accessories.
Here are the most popular videoconferencing apps:
Skype and Teams are two videoconferencing applications from
Microsoft. Skype is a straightforward videoconferencing tool that
is easy to set up and use. Teams is a more complex tool that works
seamlessly with other Microsoft products such as OneDrive and
Microsoft Office 365.
FaceTime is a videoconferencing application from Apple that has
a simple interface and is integrated into all Apple devices.
Zoom is a popular videoconferencing app that offers many
features valuable to large meetings and online classrooms.
Meet is Google’s solution to videoconferencing. It includes
many features to organize and effectively run a meeting with
several participants, including extensive integration with other
Google apps, such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and
Google Workspace.

Data Transmission
Several factors affect how data is transmitted. These factors
include bandwidth and protocols.
Bandwidth
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Bandwidth is a measurement of the width or capacity of the
communication channel. Effectively, it means how much
information can move across the communication channel in a
given amount of time. For example, to transmit text
documents, a slow bandwidth would be acceptable. However, to
effectively transmit video and audio, a wider bandwidth is
required. There are four categories of bandwidth:
Voiceband, also known as low bandwidth, is used for
landline telephone communication. At one time, personal
computers with telephone modems and dial-up service used
this bandwidth. Although effective for transmitting text
documents, it is too slow for many types of transmission,
including high-quality audio and video.
Medium band is used in special leased lines to connect
midrange computers and mainframes, as well as to transmit
data over long distances. This bandwidth is capable of
very-high-speed data transfer.
Broadband is widely used for DSL, cable, and satellite
connections to the Internet. Several users can
simultaneously use a single broadband connection for high-
speed data transfer.
Baseband is widely used to connect individual computers
that are located close to one another, such as the
computers in an office building. Like broadband, it is able
to support high-speed transmission. Unlike broadband,
however, baseband can only carry a single signal at a time.

One of the best things about a cell phone is its network
connection. However, always being connected can be stressful.
To customize your cell phone’s notifications and take a break
from your connectivity, consider the following:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
1
Mute notifications. When giving a presentation or trying to spend
some time away from your phone, it can be nice to mute your
phone’s notifications for awhile. Here’s how to do it.
For Android cell phones: Swipe down from the top of the screen
to display the notification shade and turn on the Do Not
Disturb button.
For iOS cell phones: Swipe down from the top right corner of
the screen to display the control center and tap the crescent
moon button.
2
Disable an app’s notifications. If you have an app that is
annoying you with notifications, you can limit or disable its
ability to send notifications.
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen, then choose Apps & Notifications. Tap on
Notifications and App Notifications. From here, you can click
on an app to customize its notification settings.
For iOS cell phones: Tap on the Settings icon from the home
screen, then select Notifications. A list of your apps, with a
toggle switch next to each app, will be displayed. Switch the
toggle switch to off to disable that app’s notifications.
Protocols
For data transmission to be successful, sending and receiving
devices must follow a set of communication rules for the
exchange of information. These rules for exchanging data
between computers are known as protocols.
As discussed in Chapter 2, https, or hypertext transfer
protocol secure, is widely used to protect the transfer of
sensitive information. Another widely used Internet protocol
is TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet
protocol). The essential features of this protocol involve
(1) identifying sending and receiving devices and (2)
breaking information into small parts, or packets, for
transmission across the Internet.
Identification: Every computer on the Internet has a unique
numeric address called an IP address (Internet protocol
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
address). Similar to the way a postal service uses 
addresses to deliver mail, the Internet uses IP
addresses to deliver e-mail and to locate websites. Because
these numeric addresses are difficult for people to
remember and use, a system was developed to automatically
convert text-based addresses to numeric IP addresses. This
system uses a domain name server (DNS) that converts text-
based addresses to IP addresses. For example, the URL
www.mhhe.com is easy for a person to remember and enter,
but before a connection can be made, a DNS converts this to
an IP address, such as 65.39.69.50, that computers can use
to locate that website on the Internet. (See Figure 8-12.)
Packetization: Information sent or transmitted across the
Internet usually travels through numerous interconnected
networks. Before the message is sent, it is reformatted or
broken down into small parts called packets. Each packet is
then sent separately over the Internet, possibly traveling
different routes to one common destination. At the
receiving end, the packets are reassembled into the correct
order.

Terms
There are a number of specialized terms that describe
computer networks. These terms include
Node—any device that is connected to a network. It could
be a computer, printer, or data storage device.
Client—a node that requests and uses resources available
from other nodes. Typically, a client is a user’s personal
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computing device.
Server—a node that shares resources with other 
nodes. Dedicated servers specialize in performing
specific tasks. Depending on the specific task, they may be
called an application server, communication server,
database server, file server, printer server, or web
server.
Directory server—a specialized server that manages
resources, such as user accounts, for an entire network.
Host—any computer system connected to a network that
provides access to its resources.
Router—a node that forwards or routes data packets from
one network to their destination in another network.
Switch—central node that coordinates the flow of data by
sending messages directly between sender and receiver
nodes. A hub previously filled this purpose by sending a
received message to all connected nodes, rather than just
the intended node.
Network interface cards (NICs)—as discussed in Chapter 5,
these are expansion cards located within the system unit
that connect the computer to a network. Sometimes referred
to as a LAN adapter.
Network operating systems (NOSs)—control and 
coordinate the activities of all computers and
other devices on a network. These activities include
electronic communication and the sharing of information and
resources.
Network administrator—a computer specialist responsible
for efficient network operations and implementation of new
networks.
A network may consist only of personal computers, or it
may integrate personal computers or other devices with larger
computers. Networks can be controlled by all nodes working

Network Types
Clearly, different types of channels—wired or wireless—
allow different kinds of networks to be formed. Telephone
lines, for instance, may connect communications equipment
within the same building or within a home. Networks also may
be citywide and even international, using both cable and
wireless connections. Local area, metropolitan area, and wide
area networks are distinguished by the size of the geographic
area they serve.
Local Area Networks
Networks with nodes that are in close physical proximity—
within the same building, for instance—are called local area
networks (LANs). Typically, LANs span distances less than a
mile and are owned and operated by individual organizations.
LANs are widely used by colleges, universities, and other
types of organizations to link personal computers and to
share printers and other resources. For a simple LAN, see
Figure 8-14.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Description
The LAN represented in Figure 8-14 is a typical
arrangement and provides two benefits: economy and
flexibility. People can share costly equipment. For instance,
the four personal computers share the high-speed laser
printer and the file server, which are expensive pieces of
hardware. Other equipment or nodes also may be added to the
LAN—for instance, more personal computers, a mainframe
computer, or optical disc storage devices. Additionally, the
network gateway is a device that allows one LAN to be linked
to other LANs or to larger networks. For example, the LAN of
one office group may be connected to the LAN of another
office group.
There are a variety of different standards or ways in
which nodes can be connected to one another and ways in which
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
their communications are controlled in a LAN. The most common
standard is known as Ethernet. LANs using this standard are
sometimes referred to as Ethernet LANs.
Home Networks
Although LANs have been widely used within organizations for
years, they are now being commonly used by individuals in
their homes and apartments. These LANs, called home networks,
allow different computers to share resources, including a
common Internet connection. Computers can be connected in a
variety of ways, including electrical wiring, telephone
wiring, and special cables. One of the simplest ways,
however, is without cables, or wireless.

Wireless LAN
A wireless local area network is typically referred to as a
wireless LAN (WLAN). It uses radio frequencies to connect
computers and other devices. All communications pass through
the network’s centrally located wireless access point or
base station. This access point interprets incoming radio
frequencies and routes communications to the appropriate
devices.
Wireless access points that provide Internet access are
widely available in public places such as coffee shops,
libraries, bookstores, colleges, and universities. These
access points are known as hotspots and typically use Wi-Fi
technology. Most mobile computing devices have an internal
wireless network card to connect to hotspots. If your mobile
device does not have an internal wireless network card, you
can use an external wireless adapter (see Figure 8-15) that
plugs into your computer’s USB port or PC card slot.

Personal Area Networks
A personal area network (PAN) is a type of wireless network
that works within a very small area—your immediate
surroundings. PANs connect cell phones to headsets, keyboards
to cell phones, and so on. These networks make it possible
for wireless devices to interact with each other. The most
popular PAN technology is Bluetooth, with a maximum range of
around 33 feet. Virtually all wireless peripheral devices
available today use Bluetooth, including the controllers on
popular game systems like the PlayStation and Wii.
Metropolitan Area Networks
Metropolitan area networks (MANs) span distances up to 100
miles. These networks are frequently used as links between
office buildings that are located throughout a city.

Unlike a LAN, a MAN is typically not owned by a single
organization. Rather, it is owned either by a group of
organizations or by a single network service provider that
provides network services for a fee.

Do you use your laptop to connect to wireless networks at
school or in public places such as coffee shops, airports, or
hotels? If so, it is important to use caution to protect your
computer and your privacy. Here are a few suggestions:
1
Use a firewall. A personal firewall is essential when connecting
your computer directly to public networks. Some firewalls, such as
the one built into Windows 8 and Windows 10, will ask whether a
new network should be treated as home, work, or a public network.
2
Avoid fake hotspots. Thieves are known to set up rogue (or fake)
hotspots in popular areas where users expect free Wi-Fi, such as
coffee shops and airports. Because many operating systems
automatically connect to the access point with the strongest
signal, you could be connecting to the one set up by the thief.
Always confirm that you are connecting to the access point of that
establishment. Ask an employee if you are unsure.
3
Turn off file sharing. Turning off file-sharing features in your
operating system will ensure that no one can access or modify your
files.
4
Check if connection is encrypted. If the hotspot you are using
is protected with a password, then it is likely encrypted. If it
is not, then be very careful with websites you visit and the
information you provide.
Wide Area Networks
Wide area networks (WANs) are countrywide and worldwide
networks. These networks provide access to regional service
(MAN) providers and typically span distances greater than 100
miles. They use microwave relays and satellites to reach
users over long distances—for example, from Los Angeles to
Paris. Of course, the widest of all WANs is the Internet,
which spans the entire globe.
The primary difference between a PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN is
the geographic range. Each may have various combinations of
hardware, such as personal computers, midrange computers,
mainframes, and various peripheral devices.
For a summary of network types, see Figure 8-16.

Network Architecture
Network architecture describes how a network is arranged and
how resources are coordinated and shared. It encompasses a
variety of different network specifics, including network
topologies and strategies. Network topology describes the
physical arrangement of the network. Network strategies
define how information and resources are shared.

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Topologies
A network can be arranged or configured in several different
ways. This arrangement is called the network’s topology. The
most common topologies are
Bus network—each device is connected to a common cable
called a bus or backbone, and all communications travel
along this bus.
Ring network—each device is connected to two other
devices, forming a ring. (See Figure 8-17.) When a message
is sent, it is passed around the ring until it reaches the
intended destination.
Star network—each device is connected directly to a
central network switch. (See Figure 8-18.) Whenever a node
sends a message, it is routed to the switch, which then
passes the message along to the intended recipient. The
star network is the most widely used network topology
today. It is applied to a broad range of applications from
small networks in the home to very large networks in major
corporations.
Tree network—each device is connected to a central node,
either directly or through one or more other devices. The
central node is connected to two or more subordinate nodes
that in turn are connected to other subordinate nodes, and
so forth, forming a treelike structure. (See Figure 8-19.)
This network, also known as a hierarchical network, is
often used to share corporate-wide data.
Mesh network—this topology is the newest type and does not
use a specific physical layout (such as a star or a tree).
Rather, the mesh network requires that each node have more
than one connection to the other nodes. (See Figure 8-20.)
The resulting pattern forms the appearance of a mesh. If a
path between two nodes is somehow disrupted, data can be
automatically rerouted around the failure using another

path. Wireless technologies are frequently used to build
mesh networks.

Strategies
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Every network has a strategy, or way of coordinating the
sharing of information and resources. Two of the most common
network strategies are client/server and peer-to-peer.
Client/server networks use central servers to coordinate
and supply services to other nodes on the network. The server
provides access to resources such as web pages, databases,
application software, and hardware. (See Figure 8-21.) This
strategy is based on specialization. Server nodes coordinate
and supply specialized services, and client nodes request the
services. Commonly used server operating systems are Windows
Server, macOS X Server, Linux, and Solaris.
Figure 8-21 Client/server network
Gravvi/Shutterstock
Client/server networks are widely used on the Internet.
For example, each time you open a web browser, your computer
(the client) sends out a request for a specific web page.
This request is routed over the Internet to a server. This
server locates and sends the requested material back to your
computer.
One advantage of the client/server network strategy is the
ability to handle very large networks efficiently. Another
advantage is the availability of powerful network management
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
software to monitor and control network activities. The major
disadvantages are the cost of installation and maintenance.
In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, nodes have equal
authority and can act as both clients and servers. The most
common way to share games, movies, and music over the
Internet is to use a P2P network. For example, special file-
sharing software such as BitTorrent can be used to obtain
files located on another personal computer and can provide
files to other personal computers.
P2P networks are rapidly growing in popularity as people
continue to share information with others around the world.
The primary advantage is that they are easy and inexpensive
(often free) to set up and use. One disadvantage of P2P
networks is the lack of security controls or other common
management functions. For this reason, few businesses use
this type of network to communicate sensitive information.

Organizational Networks
Computer networks in organizations have evolved over time.
Most large organizations have a complex and wide range of
different network configurations, operating systems, and
strategies. These organizations face the challenge of making
these networks work together effectively and securely.
Internet Technologies
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Many organizations today employ Internet technologies to
support effective communication within and between
organizations using intranets and extranets.
An intranet is a private network within an organization
that resembles the Internet. Like the public Internet,
intranets use browsers, websites, and web pages. Typical
applications include electronic telephone directories, e-
mail addresses, employee benefit information, 
internal job openings, and much more. Employees
find surfing their organizational intranets to be as easy
and as intuitive as surfing the Internet.
An extranet is a private network that connects more than
one organization. Many organizations use Internet
technologies to allow suppliers and others limited access
to their networks. The purpose is to increase efficiency
and reduce costs. For example, an automobile manufacturer
has hundreds of suppliers for the parts that go into making
a car. By having access to the car production schedules,
suppliers can schedule and deliver parts as they are needed
at the assembly plants. In this way, operational efficiency
is maintained by both the manufacturer and the suppliers.
Network Security
Large organizations face the challenge of ensuring that only
authorized users have access to network resources, sometimes
from multiple geographic locations or across the Internet.
Securing large computer networks requires specialized
technology. Three technologies commonly used to ensure
network security are firewalls, intrusion detection systems,
and virtual private networks.
A firewall consists of hardware and software that control
access to a company’s intranet and other internal
networks. Most use software or a special computer called a
proxy server. All communications between the company’s
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
internal networks and the outside world pass through this
server. By evaluating the source and the content of each
communication, the proxy server decides whether it is safe
to let a particular message or file pass into or out of the
organization’s network. (See Figure 8-22.)
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) work with 
firewalls to protect an organization’s network.
These systems use sophisticated statistical techniques to
analyze all incoming and outgoing network traffic. Using
advanced pattern matching and heuristics, an IDS can
recognize signs of a network attack and disable access
before an intruder can do damage.
Virtual private networks (VPNs) create a secure private
connection between a remote user and an organization’s
internal network. Special VPN protocols create the
equivalent of a dedicated line between a user’s home or
laptop computer and a company server. The connection is
heavily encrypted, and, from the perspective of the user,
it appears that the workstation is actually located on the
corporate network.

In this age of social media and cell phones, it can be difficult to
maintain your privacy on the Internet—but have you considered how to
maintain the privacy of your Internet connection? When traveling it is
common to use unfamiliar Wi-Fi connections—at a hotel, airport, or
coffee shop—but what confidence do you have that your Internet
activities won’t be monitored? Proponents of monitoring point out that
public spaces offer no guarantee of privacy and a business has the
right to monitor Internet traffic to deny inappropriate web pages.
Privacy advocates counter that many of the most common Internet
activities include private data—such as sharing photos and receiving
e-mails—and that in offering public Wi-Fi to perform common Internet
tasks, it is reasonable for a person to have an expectation of privacy.

Careers in IT
“Now
that you have learned about computer communications and
networks, let me tell you about my career as a network
administrator.”
Network administrators manage a company’s LAN and WAN
networks. They may be responsible for design,
implementation, and maintenance of networks. Duties usually
include maintenance of both hardware and software related
to a company’s intranet and Internet networks. Network
administrators are typically responsible for diagnosing and
repairing problems with these networks. Some network
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
administrators’ duties include planning and implementation
of network security as well.

Employers typically look for candidates with a
bachelor’s or an associate’s degree in computer science,
computer technology, or information systems, as well as
practical networking experience. Experience with network
security and maintenance is preferred. Also, technical
certification may be helpful in obtaining this position.
Because network administrators are involved directly with
people in many departments, good communication skills are
essential.
Network administrators can expect to earn an annual
salary of $43,000 to $84,000. Opportunities for advancement
typically include upper-management positions. This position
is expected to be among the fastest-growing jobs in the
near future.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE

Telepresence Lets You Be There without Actually
Being There
Originally, a cell phone was just a device for making a phone call. But
with improved networks and the development of the smartphone, cell phones
have become capable of much more. Today, many people don’t communicate on
a cell phone as a phone, but as a camera, through videoconferences, videos
recorded to social media, or texting photos. It is easy to see why—photos
and videos help us communicate better. These visual ways to communicate
have become common because cell phones have become more powerful, cameras
have become smaller, and networks have become faster. How will our
communications improve as technology and networks continue to grow in
power and availability? The future of communication is a world with
seamless telepresence.
Telepresence is the use of technology to create the illusion that you
are actually somewhere else. Unlike a videoconference, where a small
screen conveys the images and sounds of another location, telepresence
attempts to replicate the foreign location entirely. These technologies
include improved video and audio with immersive screens and multiple
directional speakers. But it goes further than that: Telepresence will
allow you to touch things in this other location—to interact with the
world there through robotics and even feel this other location. In the
future, telepresence will likely include robots that will allow you to
walk the halls of your office or other remote locations from the comfort
of your home. Technology will continue to evolve to improve our lives as
we look to the future.
Khakimullin Aleksandr/Shutterstock
Today’s early implementations, such as Cisco TelePresence, use very-
high-definition video, acoustically tuned audio systems, and high-speed
networks to create a very convincing videoconferencing experience.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
However, tele- presence could someday go beyond the simple voice and
videoconferencing available today, with robotics allowing the telecommuter
to change location and pick up objects. The ability to manipulate things
through robotic arms is only part of the illusion of being in another
place—you must also feel and touch the distant objects. Called haptic
technology, specialized gloves and surfaces can give the user touch
sensations that mimic holding or touching a distant object.
One of the areas where telepresence robotics are already being used is
in hospitals. Ava Robotics has developed the RP-VITA, a telepresence robot
that has multiple cameras, high-resolution screens, and complex robotics
to allow a doctor to care for and consult with patients and doctors from
around the world. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are
investigating the use of augmented reality videoconferencing to assist in
the triage and care of patients entering a hospital. Future technologies
include specialized cameras that monitor temperature, heart rate, and
respiration and haptic robotics that can assist in diagnostic testing.
Telepresence robots will also play a roll in the home. Futurists
imagine a day when a telepresence robot is as common as the vacuum
cleaner. The home telepresence robot might be taken over by skilled
technicians, such as a plumber or electrician. The telepresence robot
would maneuver around the home, reviewing your pipes or wiring, and
perform simple tests, make recommendations, and offer quotes on work to be
done. A mechanic might use a telepresence robot to perform standard
vehicle tune-ups or repairs. What do you think—could telepresence
technology improve enough to convince you that you are somewhere else, or
would the gloves and headset be too distracting?

Communications is the process of sharing data, programs,
and information between two or more computers.
Applications include texting, e-mail, videoconferencing,
and electronic commerce.
Connectivity
Connectivity is a concept related to using computer
networks to link people and resources. You can link or
connect to large computers and the Internet, providing
access to extensive information resources.
The Wireless Revolution
Mobile devices like cell phones and tablets have brought
dramatic changes in connectivity and communications.
These wireless devices are becoming widely used for
computer communication.
Communication Systems
Communication systems transmit data from one location to
another. There are four basic elements:
Sending and receiving devices originate or accept
messages.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Connection devices act as an interface between sending
and receiving devices and the communication channel.
Data transmission specifications are rules and
procedures for sending and receiving data.
Communication channel is the actual connecting or
transmission medium for messages.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Olgaviare/Getty Images
Communication channels carry data from one computer to
another.
Wireless Connections
Wireless connections do not use a solid substance to
connect devices. Most use radio waves.
WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
Access)—extends the range of Wi-Fi networks using
microwave connections.
Bluetooth—transmits data over short distances; widely
used for a variety of wireless devices.
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity)—uses high-frequency radio
signals; most home and business wireless networks use
Wi-Fi.
Microwave—line-of-sight communication; used to send
data between buildings; longer distances require
microwave stations.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Cellular—uses cell towers to send and receive data
within relatively small geographic regions or cells.
Satellite—uses microwave relay stations; GPS (global
positioning system) tracks geographic locations.
Infrared—uses light waves over a short distance;
line-of-sight communication.
Physical Connections
Physical connections use a solid medium to connect
sending and receiving devices. Connections include
twisted-pair cable (telephone lines and Ethernet
cables), coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand the concepts of connectivity, the
wireless revolution, and communication systems.
Additionally, you need to know the essential parts of
communication technology, including channels,
connection devices, data transmission, networks,
network architectures, and network types.
CONNECTION DEVICES

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Many communication systems use standard telephone lines
and analog signals. Computers use digital signals.
Modems
Modems modulate and demodulate. Transfer rate is
measured in megabits per second. Three types are
wireless (wireless wide area network, WWAN), DSL, and
cable.
Connection Services
T1, T3 (DS3), and OC (optical carrier) lines provide
support for very-high-speed, all-digital transmission for
large corporations. Cellular service providers support
voice and data transmission using cellular networks.
These mobile telecommunications networks have gone
through different generations—1G, using analog radio
signals; 2G, using digital radio signals; 3G, beginning
of cell phones; 4G, using LTE (Long Term Evolution); and
5G, the newest and fastest network.
Other more affordable technologies include dial-up,
DSL (digital subscriber line), ADSL (widely used),
cable, fiber-optic service (FiOS), and satellite.
DATA TRANSMISSION
Bandwidth measures a communication channel’s width or
capacity. Four bandwidths are voiceband, medium band,
broadband, and baseband. Protocols are rules for
exchanging data. Internet protocols include https and
TCP/IP. IP addresses (Internet protocol addresses) are
unique numeric Internet addresses. DNS (domain name
server) converts text-based addresses to and from
numeric IP addresses. Packets are small parts of
messages.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
NETWORKS
Computer networks connect two or more computers. Some
specialized network terms include
Node—any device connected to a network.
Client—node requesting resources.
Server—node providing resources.
Directory server—specialized node that manages
resources.
Host—any computer system that provides access to its
resources over a network.
Router—a node that forwards data packets from one
network to another network.
Switch—node that coordinates direct flow of data
between other nodes. Hub is an older device that
directed flow to all nodes.
NIC (network interface card)—LAN adapter card for
connecting to a network.
NOS (network operating system)—controls and
coordinates network operations.
Network administrator—network specialist responsible
for network operations.
NETWORK TYPES
Networks can be citywide or even international, using
both wired and wireless connections.
Local area networks (LANs) connect nearby devices.
Network gateways connect networks to one another.
Ethernet is a LAN standard. These LANs are called
Ethernet LANs.
Home networks are LANs used in homes.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Wireless LANs (WLANs) use a wireless access point
(base station) as a hub. Hotspots provide Internet
access in public places.
Personal area networks (PANs) are wireless networks
for Bluetooth headphones, cell phones, and other
wireless devices.
Metropolitan area networks (MANs) link office
buildings within a city, spanning up to 100 miles.
Wide area networks (WANs) are the largest type. They
span states and countries or form worldwide networks.
The Internet is the largest wide area network in the
world.

NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
Network architecture describes how networks are arranged
and resources are shared.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Topologies
A network’s topology describes the physical arrangement
of a network.
Bus network—each device is connected to a common
cable called a bus or backbone.
Ring network—each device is connected to two other
devices, forming a ring.
Star network—each device is connected directly to a
central network switch; most common type today.
Tree (hierarchical) network—a central node is
connected to subordinate nodes forming a treelike
structure.
Mesh network—newest; each node has two or more
connecting nodes.
Strategies
Every network has a strategy, or way of sharing
information and resources. Common network strategies
include client/server and peer-to-peer.
Client/server (hierarchical) network—central
computers coordinate and supply services to other
nodes; based on specialization of nodes; widely used on
the Internet; able to handle very large networks
efficiently; powerful network management software
available.
Peer-to-peer network—nodes have equal authority and
act as both clients and servers; widely used to share
games, movies, and music over the Internet; easy to set
up and use; lacks security controls.
ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Internet Technologies
Internet technologies support effective communication
using intranets and extranets.
Intranet—private network within an organization; uses
browsers, websites, and web pages. Typical applications
include electronic telephone directories, e-mail
addresses, employee benefit information, internal job
openings, and much more.
Extranet—like intranet except connects more than one
organization; typically allows suppliers and others
limited access to their networks.
Network Security
Three technologies commonly used to ensure network
security are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
virtual private networks.
Firewall—controls access; all communications pass
through a proxy server.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs)—work with
firewalls; use sophisticated statistical techniques to
recognize and disable network attacks.
Virtual private network (VPN)—creates secure private

“Hi,
I’m Ann, and I’m an IT security analyst. I’d like to
talk with you about privacy, security, and ethics, three critical
topics for anyone who uses computers today. I would also like to
talk about how you can protect your privacy, ensure your security,
and act ethically.”

There are more than 1 billion personal computers in use today. What are
the consequences of the widespread presence of this technology? Does
technology make it easy for others to invade our personal privacy? When we
apply for a loan or for a driver’s license, or when we check out at the
supermarket, is that information about us being distributed and used
without our permission? When we use the web, is information about us being
collected and shared with others? How can criminals use this information
for ransom, blackmail, or vandalism?
This technology prompts lots of questions—very important questions.
Perhaps these are some of the most important questions for the 21st
century. To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be
aware of the potential impact of technology on people and how to protect
yourself on the web. You need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about
personal privacy and organizational security.
People
As we have discussed, information systems consist of people,
procedures, software, hardware, data, and the Internet. This
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
chapter focuses on people. Although most everyone agrees that
technology has had a very positive impact on people, it is
important to recognize the negative, or potentially negative,
impacts as well.
Effective implementation of computer technology involves
maximizing its positive effects while minimizing its negative
effects. The most significant concerns are
Privacy: What are the threats to personal privacy, and how
can we protect ourselves?
Security: How can access to sensitive information be
controlled, and how can we secure hardware and software?
Ethics: How do the actions of individual users and
companies affect society?
Let us begin by examining privacy.
Privacy
To appreciate the impact that the digital revolution is
having on our world, you need look no further than the cell
phone in your pocket. A cell phone is a marvel that provides
a camera, microphone, and minuscule sensors ready to share
your life with the world. With these new tools come new
challenges to old ways of thinking. What does it mean to
preserve privacy in a social media world where every
experience is recorded and preserved? Who owns the memories
we create with these devices? Who has the right to share
them? To delete them? To profit from them?

Privacy concerns the collection and use of data about
individuals. There are three primary privacy issues:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Accuracy relates to the responsibility of those who collect
data to ensure that the data is correct.
Property relates to who owns data.
Access relates to the responsibility of those who have data
to control who is able to use that data.
Big Data
Today, almost all human events are recorded digitally. For
example, making a phone call, posting a video to social
media, or wearing a smartwatch creates a digital record. A
digital record of a phone call can include who you called,
when you called, where you were when you made the call, and
even the contents of the conversation itself. This results in
an unprecedented amount of digital information being stored.
This stored information is often referred to as big data.
Large organizations are constantly compiling information
about us. The federal government alone has over 2,000
databases. For example, credit card companies maintain user
databases that track cardholder purchases, payments, and
credit records. Supermarket scanners in grocery checkout
counters record what we buy, when we buy it, how much we buy,
and the price. Financial institutions, including banks and
credit unions, record how much money we have, what we use it
for, and how much we owe. Search engines record the search
histories of their users, including search topics and sites
visited. Social networking sites collect every entry.
This collection of data can be searched to find all the
action of one person—creating a digital footprint that
reveals a highly detailed account of your life. A vast
industry of data gatherers known as information resellers or
information brokers now exists that collects, analyzes, and
sells such personal data. (See Figure 9-1.)

Acxiom
Your digital footprint can reveal more than you might wish
to make public and have an impact beyond what you might
imagine. This raises many important issues, including
Collecting public, but personally identifying,
information: What if people anywhere in the world could
view detailed images of you, your home, or your vehicle?
Using detailed images captured with a specially equipped
van, Google’s Street View project allows just that. Street
View makes it possible to take a virtual tour of many
cities and neighborhoods from any computer with a 
connection to the Internet. (See Figure 9-2.)
Although the images available on Street View are all taken
in public locations, some have objected to the project as
being an intrusion on their privacy.
As digital cameras and webcams become cheaper and
software becomes more sophisticated, it is likely that many
more issues involving personal privacy in public spaces
will need to be addressed. Such a combination of computing
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
technologies could, for example, make real-time tracking of
individuals in public places possible.
Spreading information without personal consent: How would
you feel if an employer were using your Facebook, Twitter,
or other social networking profiles to make decisions about
hiring, placement, promotion, and firing? It is a common
practice today for many organizations.
As we have discussed in Chapter 2, social networking is
designed for open sharing of information among individuals
who share a common interest. Unfortunately, this openness
can put individuals using social networking sites at risk.
In fact, some have lost their jobs after posting
unflattering remarks about their supervisor or after
discussing their dislike of their current job. Deeper
analysis of your social networking profile may reveal even
more about yourself than you intend.
The potential to inadvertently share personal
information extends past what you might post to your social
networking site. As an example, without your knowledge or
permission, a social networking friend might tag or
identify you in a photo on his or her site. Once tagged,
that photo can become part of your digital footprint and
available to others without your consent.
Spreading inaccurate information: How would you like to be
turned down for a home loan because of an error in your
credit history? This is much more common than you might
expect. What if you could not find a job or were fired from
a job because of an error giving you a serious criminal
history? This can and has happened due to simple clerical
errors. In one case, an arresting officer while completing
an arrest warrant incorrectly recorded the Social Security
number of a criminal. From that time forward, this arrest
and the subsequent conviction became part of another
person’s digital footprint. This is an example of mistaken

identity in which the digital footprint of one person is
switched with another.

It’s important to know that you have some recourse. The
law allows you to gain access to those records about you
that are held by credit bureaus. Under the Freedom of
Information Act, you are also entitled to look at your
records held by government agencies. (Portions may be
deleted for national security reasons.)

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Sharing personal information on social media is a necessary part of
creating and participating in an online community. However, many
individuals do not fully understand the complex sharing and privacy
policies of these networks. This often causes unintentional sharing
with people outside their intended social circle. The social networks
themselves have come under fire from privacy groups, who say that these
companies use complex settings and policies to get users to share more
information than intended. This information is in turn shared with
advertisers. Do you think social networking companies are doing enough
to ensure the privacy and security of the communities they serve?
Private Networks
Suppose you use your company’s electronic mail system to
send a co-worker an unflattering message about your
supervisor or to send a highly personal message to a friend.
Later you find the boss has been reading these e-mails. In
fact, many businesses search employees’ electronic mail and
computer files using employee-monitoring software. These
programs record virtually everything you do on your computer.
Many people incorrectly assume that their employers won’t or
can’t monitor employee activity on work computers and
networks. You should never do anything on a work computer or
a work network connection that you wouldn’t want shared with
your employer. If you are employed and would like to know
your company’s current policy on monitoring electronic
communication, contact your human relations department.

The Internet and the Web
When you send a message or browse the web, do you have any
concerns about privacy? Most people do not. They think that
as long as they are using their own computer and are
selective about disclosing their names or other personal
information, then little can be done to invade their personal
privacy. Experts call this the illusion of anonymity that
the Internet brings.
As we discussed in Chapter 8, every computer on the
Internet is identified by a unique number known as an IP
address. IP addresses can be used to trace Internet
activities to their origin, allowing computer security
experts and law enforcement officers to investigate computer
crimes such as unauthorized access to networks or sharing
copyright files without permission.
Some websites are designed to be hidden from standard
search engines. These websites make up the deep web and allow
communication in a secure and anonymous manner. One part of
the deep web is hidden websites that make up the dark web.
These websites use special software that hides a user’s IP
address and makes it nearly impossible to identify who is
using the site. The ability to communicate anonymously
attracts criminals who want to sell drugs, share child
pornography, or profit from the poaching of endangered
animals. This same anonymity allows people in countries where
political dissent is dangerous and free speech is censored to
communicate, plan, and organize toward a more free and open
society without fear of jail or execution.
When you browse the web, your browser stores critical
information, typically without you being aware of it. This
information, which contains records about your Internet
activities, includes history and temporary Internet files.
History files include the locations, or addresses, of sites
that you have recently visited. This history file can be
displayed by your browser in various locations, including
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the address bar (as you type) and the History page. To view
your browsing history on your Android or iOS cell phone,
see Figure 9-3.
Temporary Internet files, also known as the 
browser cache, contain web page content and
instructions for displaying this content. Whenever you
visit a website, these files are saved by your browser. If
you leave a site and then return later, these files are
used to quickly redisplay web content.

Another way your web activity can be monitored is with
cookies. Cookies are small data files that are deposited on
your hard disk from websites you have visited. Based on your
browser’s settings, these cookies can be accepted or
blocked. Although you will generally not be aware when a
website generates a cookie, the personalized experiences you
enjoy on the web are often a result of those cookies.
Although cookies are harmless in and of themselves, what
makes them a potential privacy risk is that they can store
information about you, your preferences, and your browsing
habits. The information stored generally depends on whether
the cookie is a first-party or a third-party cookie.
A first-party cookie is one that is generated (and then
read) only by the website you are currently visiting. Many
websites use first-party cookies to store information about
the current session, your general preferences, and your
activity on the site. The intention of these cookies is to
provide a personalized experience on a particular site. For
example, when you are shopping online, you might fill your
cart with items and then leave the site without making
making a purchase. Cookies allow you to return to that site
and have the site remember what was in your cart.
A third-party cookie is usually generated by an advertising
company that is affiliated with the website you are
currently visiting. These cookies are used by the
advertising company to keep track of your web activity as
you move from one site to the next. For this reason, they
are often referred to as tracking cookies. Critics of this
practice claim that your privacy is being violated because
your activity is being recorded across multiple 
websites. Defenders of this practice argue that
these cookies are beneficial because they help websites
deliver ads that interest you. For example, suppose you
visit four different websites that employ the same
advertising agency. The first three sites are about cars,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
but the fourth is a search engine. When you visit the
fourth site, you will likely see a car advertisement
because your cookie showed that you had been visiting car-
related websites.
Some users are not comfortable with the idea of web
browsers storing so much information in the form of temporary
Internet files, cookies, and history. For this reason,
browsers now offer users an easy way to delete their browsing
history. To see how to delete browsing histories on your
Android or iOS cell phone, see Figure 9-4. In addition, most
browsers also offer a privacy mode, which ensures that your
browsing activity is not recorded on your hard disk. For
example, Google Chrome provides Incognito Mode accessible
from the Chrome menu, and Safari provides Private Browsing
accessible from the Safari option on the main menu.

privacy
Google’s Chrome web browser erases any record of your web activities
from your computer while using Incognito Mode. Many believe this means
that Google will not record your activities on the web. However, it
does not erase your activities recorded on the computers that run the
websites that you visit. For example, Google’s websites will record
information about your activities even when you are in Incognito Mode.
What do you think? Does Google Chrome’s promise of private browsing
include the information that Google collects on its websites?
Although these web browser files can concern many
individuals, several other threats could potentially violate
your privacy. Web bugs, which are invisible images or HTML
code hidden within a web page or e-mail message, can be used
to transmit information without your knowledge. When a user
opens an e-mail containing a web bug, information is sent
back to the source of the bug. The receiving server will now
know that this e-mail address is active. One of the most
common web bugs is used by companies that sell active mailing
lists to spammers. Because of this deception, many e-mail
programs now block images and HTML code from unknown senders.
It is up to the user to decide whether or not to allow such
content to be displayed for current and future messages.
The most dangerous type of privacy threat comes in the
form of spyware. The term spyware is used to describe a wide
range of programs that are designed to secretly record and
report an individual’s activities on the Internet. Some of
these programs can even make changes to your browser in order
to deceive you and manipulate what you see online. Computer
monitoring software is perhaps the most invasive and
dangerous type of spyware. One type of computer 
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
monitoring software, known as a keylogger, records every
activity and keystroke made on your computer system,
including credit card numbers, passwords, and e-mail
messages. Computer monitoring software can be deposited onto
your hard drive without your knowledge by a malicious website
or by someone installing the program directly onto your
computer. Although such software is deadly in the hands of
criminals, it can be legally used by companies monitoring
employees or law enforcement officials who are collecting
evidence.
Unfortunately, many spyware programs go undetected,
largely because users have no idea they are infected. Spyware
will run in the background, invisible to the average user.
Other times, it disguises itself as useful software, such as
a security program. Spyware is alarmingly common on laptops
and desktops, but recent spyware is designed to work on other
types of computers. For example, Pegasus is spyware designed
to work on iOs and Android cell phones. The financial impact
to individuals, companies, and financial institutions is
estimated at billions of dollars.
ethics
Data encryption protects your bank accounts and private e-mails, but it
also allows criminals to hide evidence from police. Some government
agencies want to limit the power of data encryption to make it easier
to find and jail criminals. Privacy advocates argue that limiting
encryption gives criminals and dictators tools that will be used to
steal data and suppress freedoms. Security advocates respond that to
protect citizens from criminals, the police must be able to search
encrypted devices when warranted. Should governments be given a
skeleton key to bypass encryption? Should unbreakable encryption be
illegal?
One of the best defenses against spyware is to exercise
caution when visiting new websites and downloading software
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
from an unknown source. Another defense involves using a
category of software known as antispyware or spy removal
programs, which are designed to detect and remove various
types of privacy threats. (See Figure 9-5.) For a list of
some of these programs, see Figure 9-6.

Online Identity
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Another aspect of Internet privacy comes from online
identity, the information that people voluntarily post about
themselves online. With the popularity of social networking,
blogging, and photo- and video-sharing sites, many people
post intimate details of their lives without considering the
consequences. Although it is easy to think of online identity
as something shared between friends, the archiving and search
features of the web make it available indefinitely to anyone
who cares to look.
There are any number of cases of people who have lost
their jobs on the basis of posts on social networking sites.
These job losses range from a teacher (using off-color
language and photos showing drinking) to a chief financial
officer of a major corporation (discussing corporate dealings
and financial data). The cases include college graduates
being refused a job because of Facebook posts. How would you
feel if information you posted about yourself on the web kept
you from getting a job?

Major Laws on Privacy
Some federal laws governing privacy matters have been
created. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protects
personal financial information, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects medical
records, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA) restricts disclosure of educational records.
Most of the information collected by private organizations
is not covered by existing laws. However, as more and more
individuals become concerned about controlling who has the
right to personal information and how that information is
used, companies and lawmakers will respond.

Security
Personal security protects us from crime and danger in the
physical world. For example, bank security protects our
savings, home security protects our families, and airport
security protect our safety. The digital revolution brings
with it new types of crimes and dangers. To protect ourselves
from these new threats, computer security needs to protect
our information, hardware, and software from unauthorized
use, as well as preventing or limiting the damage from
intrusions, sabotage, and natural disasters.
Cybercrime
Cybercrime or computer crime is any criminal offense that
involves a computer and a network. Cybercrimes are often in
the news, especially cyberterrorism, which is a politically
motivated cybercrime. It was recently estimated that
cybercrime affects over 400 million people and costs over
$400 billion each year. Cybercrimes can take various forms,
including identity theft, Internet scams, data manipulation,
ransomware, and denial of service attacks.
Identity theft is the illegal assumption of someone’s
identity for the purposes of economic gain. Stolen
identities are used to steal credit cards and mail and to
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
commit other crimes. It is estimated that identity thieves
stole $16 billion and victimized 15.4 million individuals.
Internet scams are scams using the Internet. Internet scams
have created financial and legal problems for many
thousands of people. Almost all the scams are initiated by
a mass mailing to unsuspecting individuals. Recently,
Interpol busted a criminal network of 40 people across
Nigeria, Malaysia, and South Africa accused of 
using Internet scams to steal more than $60
million. See Figure 9-7 for a list of common types of
Internet scams.
Type Description
Phishing Communications in which a criminal pretends to
be from an official organization and tricks you
into giving them sensitive data, such as
passwords, bank account numbers, etc. Often
these communications include a link to a
website that looks like an official log-in
screen but in fact is a fake website designed
to trick people into giving up their username
and password.
Advanced- A classic e-mail scam. The recipient receives
fee scam an e-mail from a wealthy foreigner in distress
who needs your bank account information to
safely store his or her wealth, and for your
troubles you will receive a large amount of
money. Of course, once the scammer has your
bank account information, your accounts will be
drained and he or she will disappear.
Greeting An e-mail or social media communication informs
card scam you that a friend has sent you a greeting card
and you need to download software to view it.
In fact, the software is malware that can steal
your data and infect your computer.
Bank Criminals acting as bank or credit card
loan/credit officials offer you unusually good deals on
card scam bank loans or credit cards—but these are just
attempts to get you to pay huge “processing
fees” and to get your personal information.

tips
Identity theft is a growing problem, and can be financially
devastating if you are a victim. Thieves are after anything
that can help them steal your identity, from your Social
Security number and date of birth to account information and
passwords. Here are some steps to help protect your identity:
1
Be careful what you post on the Internet. Never post personal
information on forums or social networking areas that are public
or in response to an e-mail from someone you do not know or trust.
2
Only do business on the Internet with companies you know to be
legitimate.
3
When selling a computer, be sure to completely remove all personal
information from the hard drive. To ensure that your personal
information is erased, consider using a free erasure software
tool, such as Dban (dban.org).
4
Monitor your credit. Each year, you are entitled to a free personal
credit report from each of the three major credit reporting
agencies. Monitor your credit by requesting a report every four
months from a different reporting agency. The official site for
this service is www.annualcreditreport.com.
Data manipulation is the unauthorized access of a computer
network and copying files to or from the server. This can
be as simple as making a post on Facebook when logged in as
someone else or as complex as feeding a company false
reports to change its business practices. Unlike other
cybercrimes, data manipulation can occur for months, even
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
years, without the victims being aware of the security
breach, making it hard to detect.
Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts your
computer’s data and ransoms the password to the user.
Ransomware criminals have targeted food processing plants,
hospitals, and police stations, endangering the health and
safety of millions. Most recently, a ransomware attack on
the Colonial Pipeline caused fuel shortages that grounded
airplanes and closed gas stations across the southeastern
United States in the summer of 2021.
Denial of service (DoS) attacks attempt to slow down or
stop a computer system or network by flooding a computer or
network with requests for information and data. These
requests can come from a single computer issuing repeated
requests. Widely used today is a variation known as
distributed denial of service (DDoS), which coordinates
several computers making repeated requests for service. The
targets of these attacks are usually Internet service
providers (ISPs) and specific websites. Once under attack,
the servers at the ISP or the website become overwhelmed
with these requests for service and are unable to respond
to legitimate users. As a result, the ISP or website is
effectively shut down.
With cybercrime on the rise and the high-profile victims
of cybercrime in the news, it is important to understand
the tools the cybercriminal uses to harm his victims.
Knowledge of these tools will help you make smarter choices
and protect yourself from becoming a victim. The tools of
the cybercriminal include social engineering, malicious
software, and malicious hardware. For a summary of
cybercrimes, see Figure 9-8.

Social Engineering
Often the least secure parts of a network or computer are the
humans who work with it. Social engineering is the practice
of manipulating people to divulge private data. For example,
a criminal may call you at work, pretending to be an IT
worker who needs your password and user name, or they may
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
“friend” you on social media to get access to private
information. Social engineering has played a key role in
identity theft, Internet scams, and data manipulation. One of
the most common social engineering techniques is phishing
(pronounced “fishing”). Phishing attempts to trick Internet
users into thinking a fake but official-looking website or e-
mail is legitimate. Phishing has grown in sophistication,
replicating entire websites, like PayPal, to try to lure
users into divulging their financial information.
privacy
Did you know that the World Wide Web contains websites purposely hidden
from you? Some websites are designed to be hidden from standard search
engines and allow people to communicate in a secure and anonymous
manner. These hidden websites make up the dark web and require special
software that makes it nearly impossible to identify who is using it.
The ability to communicate anonymously attracts criminals who want to
sell drugs, share child pornography, or profit from the poaching of
endangered animals. This same anonymity allows people in countries
where political dissent is dangerous and free speech is censored to
communicate, plan, and organize toward a more free and open society
without fear of jail or execution. Prior to reading this Privacy
section, were you aware of the dark web? Do you think it should be
stopped? Do you think it should be regulated?
Malicious Software
A cracker is a computer criminal who creates and distributes
malicious programs or malware, which is short for malicious
software. Malware is specifically designed to damage or
disrupt a computer system. The three most common types of
malware are viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.
Viruses are programs that migrate through networks and
operating systems, and mostly attach themselves to other
programs and databases. Although some viruses are
relatively harmless, many can be quite destructive. Once
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
activated, these destructive viruses can alter and/or
delete files.
Worms are programs that simply replicate themselves over
and over again. Once active in a network, the self-
replicating activity clogs computers and networks until
their operations are slowed or stopped. Unlike a virus, a
worm typically does not attach itself to a program or alter
and/or delete files. Worms, however, can carry a virus.
Once a virus has been deposited by a worm onto an
unsuspecting computer system, the virus will either
activate immediately or lie dormant until some future time.
Trojan horses are programs that appear to be harmless;
however, they contain malicious programs. Trojan horses are
not viruses. Like worms, however, they can be carriers of
viruses. The most common types of Trojan horses appear as
free computer games and free antivirus software that can be
downloaded from the Internet. When a user installs one of
these programs, the Trojan horse also secretly installs a
virus on the computer system. The virus then begins its
mischief. Some of the most common Trojan horses claim to
provide free antivirus programs. When a user downloads one
of these programs, the Trojan horse first installs a virus
that locates and disables any existing virus protection
programs before depositing other viruses.
Malicious Hardware
Criminals use computer hardware to steal information, infect
computers with malicious software, and disrupt computer
systems. The most common malicious hardware includes zombie
botnets, rogue Wi-Fi hotspots, and infected USB flash drives.
Zombies are computers infected by a virus, worm, or Trojan
horse that allows them to be remotely controlled for
malicious purposes. A collection of zombie computers is
known as a botnet, or robot network. Botnets harness the
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
combined power of many zombies for malicious activities
like password cracking, denial of service attacks, or
sending junk e-mail. Because they are formed by many
computers distributed across the Internet, botnets are hard
to shut down even after they are detected. Unfortunately
for individual computer owners, it also can be difficult to
detect when a personal computer has been compromised.
Rogue Wi-Fi hotspots imitate free Wi-Fi networks. These
rogue networks operate close to the legitimate free
hotspots and typically provide stronger signals that many
users unsuspectingly connect to. Once connected, the rogue
networks capture any and all information sent by 
the users to legitimate sites, including user names
and passwords.
Infected USB flash drives contain viruses and other
malicious software. Crackers typically leave these drives
in public spaces in the hope that others will find them,
plug them into their computer, and become infected.
Infected drives have also been found distributed for free
at conferences and slipped into people’s mailboxes.

Measures to Protect Computer Security
There are numerous ways in which computer systems and data
can be compromised and many ways to ensure computer security.
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it a crime for
unauthorized persons even to view—let alone copy or damage—
data using any computer across state lines. It also prohibits
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
unauthorized use of any government computer or a computer
used by any federally insured financial institution.
Offenders can be sentenced up to 20 years in prison and fined
up to $100,000. However, the best protection for computer
security is to be prepared. Some of the principal measures to
ensure computer security are restricting access, encrypting
data, anticipating disasters, and preventing data loss.
Restricting Access Security experts are constantly devising
ways to protect computer systems from access by unauthorized
persons. Sometimes security is a matter of putting guards on
company computer rooms and checking the identification of
everyone admitted. However, the most common way to restrict
access is the use of a password. Passwords are secret words
or phrases (including numbers, letters, and special
characters) that must be keyed into a computer system to gain
access. For many applications on the web, users assign their
own passwords.
tips
Security professionals warn that most people use passwords that
are too easily guessed. They categorize passwords as weak
(easily guessed) or strong (difficult to guess). A weak
password can be guessed in a matter of seconds; a strong one
would take years to crack. Make sure you have a strong password
by employing the following tips when creating a password.
1
Use a password with at least eight characters. The fewer the
characters, the easier it is to guess.
2
Do not use your user name, real name, or company name in your
password. The first thing a cracker will try is variations of your
personal information.
3
Do not use a complete word. Using a computer, a cracker can easily
try every word in the dictionary as a password guess.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
4
Do not reuse passwords. If a user’s password for one account is
compromised, crackers will attempt to use that password on the
user’s other accounts.
5
Create a password that contains at least one of each of the
following characters: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number,
and symbol.
The strength of a password depends on how easily it can be
guessed. A dictionary attack uses software to try thousands
of common words sequentially to gain unauthorized access to a
user’s account. For this reason, words, names, and simple
numeric patterns make weak or poor passwords. Strong
passwords have at least eight characters and use a
combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Newer technology allows access to be restricted by
passwords that do not require secret words or phrases.
Windows 10 includes an application, Picture 
Password, that accepts a series of gestures over
a picture of the user’s choice to gain access. Other times,
biometric scanning devices such as fingerprint and iris (eye)
scanners are used to access restricted data. (See Figure 9-
9.) Numerous applications use face recognition to allow
access to a computer system. For example, Microsoft’s
Windows 11 and Apple’s iOS 15 include facial recognition

and automatically log them in. There are also several face

ethics
When you lock your cell phone, it encrypts your data so that no one
else can see your data without unlocking your phone. This also allows
criminals to hide information on their cell phones from the police.
Some software companies have discovered flaws in cell phone security
and sell software that exploit these flaws and break open locked cell
phones. U.S. law enforcement agencies have used this software to break
open criminals’ cell phones.
Unfortunately this software is also purchased and used by dictators
and tyrants to spy on their populace and imprison political dissenters.
Does a company that discovers a security flaw have an ethical
responsibility to not exploit the flaw, but instead work with cell
phone companies to eliminate the flaw? Should there be limitations on
the tools U.S. agencies can purchase, if that purchase helps a company
that helps dictators?
As mentioned in previous chapters, individuals and
organizations use a variety of ways to perform and automate
important security tasks:
Security suites provide a collection of utility programs
designed to protect your privacy and security while you are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
on the web. These programs alert users when certain kinds
of viruses and worms enter their system. Two of the most
widely used are Avast! Free Antivirus and Microsoft Windows
Defender. Unfortunately, new viruses are being developed
all the time, and not all viruses can be detected. The best
way to stay current is through services that keep track of
viruses on a daily basis. For example, Symantec, McAfee,
and Microsoft all track the most serious virus threats.
(See Figure 9-10.)
Firewalls act as a security buffer between a corporation’s
private network and all external networks, including the
Internet. All electronic communications coming into and
leaving the corporation must pass through the company’s
firewall, where they are evaluated. Security is maintained
by denying access to unauthorized communications.
Password managers help you create strong passwords.
Additionally, they will store all your passwords in one
location and automatically provide the appropriate password
when requested from one of your favorite sites. This avoids
many of the mistakes people make in generating and
remembering passwords. However, this master list of
passwords is protected by one ”master” password. If you
forget or reveal this master password, you open yourself up
to considerable risk.
Authentication is the process of ensuring the 
identity of a user. When you enter a password to
gain access to a site, that is a single authentication of
your identity. For added security, some security systems
require multiple authentications. Two-factor
authentication uses two types (or factors) of data to
verify your identity. These types of data include knowledge
(such as a password or the answer to a security question),
possession (such as your cell phone or credit card), and
biometric data (such as a finger print or voice print).
Two-step authentication uses one type of authentication
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
twice (such as asking for two knowledge-based
authentications such as a password and the answer to a
security question). While both types are more secure that a
single authenication, two-factor authentication is
considered more secure than two-step authentication—and
both are more secure than a single authentication.

tips
Has your cell phone ever been lost or stolen? If so, then you
not only are without the device, but you also have lost any
data (photos, contact lists, etc.). To avoid this, you need to
take some action before your cell phone goes missing. Consider
the following suggestions.
1
Find your phone. Set up your phone so that you can see a map of
where your phone is and remotely turn on an alarm, secure the
device, and even erase the contents of your cell phone.
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen and then choose Security & Lock Screen and Device
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
administrators. Finally, tap on Find My Device. If your phone
goes missing, go to android.com/find to find or remotely secure
your device.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the home
screen and then select your Apple ID at the top of the screen.
Select iCloud and turn on the button for Find My iPhone. If
your phone goes missing, sign in to icloud.com/find to find or
remotely secure your device.
2
Back up your phone. Automatically back up your cell phone data to
the cloud, so even if you cannot recover your phone, your data
will not be lost. To enable these features, you will need an
iCloud or Google Drive account.
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen and then choose Backup. Turn on the button for
Backup to Google Drive.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the home
screen and then select your Apple ID at the top of the screen.
Select iCloud and turn on the button for iCloud Backup.
Encrypting Data Whenever information is sent over a network
or stored on a computer system, the possibility of
unauthorized access exists. The solution is encryption, the
process of coding information to make it unreadable except to
those who have a special piece of information known as an
encryption key, or, simply, a key. Some common uses for
encryption include
E-mail encryption: Protects e-mail messages as they move
across the Internet. One of the most widely used personal
e-mail encryption programs is Pretty Good Privacy. (See
Figure 9-11.)
File encryption: Protects sensitive files by encrypting
them before they are stored on a hard drive. Files can be
encrypted individually, or specialized software can be used
to encrypt all files automatically each time they 
are saved to a certain hard drive location. (See
Figure 9-12.)
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Website encryption: Secures web transactions, especially
financial transactions. Web pages that accept passwords or
confidential information like a credit card number are
often encrypted.
As we discussed in Chapters 2 and 8, https (hypertext
transfer protocol secure) is the most widely used Internet
protocol. This protocol requires that the browser and the
connecting site encrypt all messages, providing a safer and
more secure transmission.
Virtual private networks: Virtual private networks (VPNs)
encrypt connections between company networks and remote
users such as workers connecting from home. This connection
creates a secure virtual connection to a company LAN across
the Internet.
Wireless network encryption: Restricts access to 
authorized users on wireless networks. WPA2 (Wi-Fi
Protected Access) is the most widely used wireless network
encryption for home wireless networks. WPA2 is typically
established for a wireless network through the network’s
wireless router. Although the specifics vary between
routers, WPA2 is usually set through the router’s settings
options.

Anticipating Disasters Companies (and even individuals)
should prepare themselves for disasters. Physical security is
concerned with protecting hardware from possible human and
natural disasters. Data security is concerned with protecting
software and data from unauthorized tampering or damage. Most
large organizations have disaster recovery plans describing
ways to continue operating until normal computer operations
can be restored.
Preventing Data Loss Equipment can always be replaced. A
company’s data, however, may be irreplaceable. Most
companies have ways of trying to keep software and data from
being tampered with in the first place. They include careful
screening of job applicants, guarding of passwords, and
auditing of data and programs from time to time. Some systems
use redundant storage to prevent loss of data even when a
hard drive fails. We discussed RAID in Chapter 7, which is a
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
commonly used type of redundant storage. Backup batteries
protect against data loss due to file corruption during
unexpected power outages.
Making frequent backups of data is essential to prevent
data loss. Backups are often stored at an off-site location
to protect data in case of theft, fire, flood, or other
disasters. Students and others often use flash drives and
cloud storage, as discussed in Chapter 7, to back up homework
and important papers. Incremental backups store multiple
versions of data at different points in time to prevent data
loss due to unwanted changes or accidental deletion.
To see what you should do to protect yourself, see Making
IT Work for You: Security and Technology on pages 232–233.
See Figure 9-13 for a summary of the different measures to
protect computer security.

Ethics
New technologies create new opportunities and interactions
for everyone. For a criminal, these new opportunities may
include new computer crimes to commit. For a police officer,
this means new cybercrime laws and new ways to serve and
protect. As we explore the impact of digital identities and
digital lives, we must reexamine our standards of moral
conduct, or ethics, in the context of these new opportunities
and interactions. Computer ethics are guidelines for the
morally acceptable use of computers in our society. Ethical
treatment is critically important to us all, and we are all
entitled to ethical treatment. This includes the right to
keep personal information, such as credit ratings and medical
histories, from getting into unauthorized hands. These
issues, largely under the control of corporations and
government agencies, were covered earlier in this chapter,
and many more have been addressed in the Ethics boxes
throughout this book. Now we’ll examine three important
issues in computer ethics where average users have a role to
play.
Cyberbullying
A fairly recent and all-too-common phenomenon, cyberbullying
is the use of the Internet to send or post content intended
to hurt or embarrass another person. Although not always a
crime, it can lead to criminal prosecution. Cyberbullying
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
includes sending repeated unwanted e-mails to an individual
who has stated that he or she wants no further contact with
the sender, ganging up on victims in electronic forums,
posting false statements designed to injure the reputation of
another, maliciously disclosing personal data about a person
that could lead to harm to that person, and sending any type
of communication that is threatening or harassing. Never
participate in cyberbullying, and discourage others from
participating in this dangerous and hateful activity. If you
or someone you know is the victim of cyberbullying, go to
stopbullying.gov for help and advice.
Copyright and Digital Rights Management
A copyright is a legal concept that gives content creators
the right to control use and distribution of their work.
Materials that can be copyrighted include paintings, books,
music, films, and even video games. Some users choose to make
unauthorized copies of digital media, which violates
copyright. For example, making an unauthorized copy of a
digital music file for a friend might be a copyright
violation.Software
piracy is the unauthorized copying and/or
distribution of software. According to a recent study,
software piracy costs the software industry over $60 billion
annually. To prevent copyright violations, corporations often
use digital rights management (DRM). DRM encompasses various
technologies that control access to electronic media and
files. Typically, DRM is used to (1) control the number of
devices that can access a given file and (2) limit the kinds
of devices that can access a file. Although some companies
see DRM as a necessity to protect their rights, some users
feel they should have the right to use the media they buy—
including movies, music, software, and video games—as they
choose.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
ethics
Net neutrality is the policy that ISPs should deliver all data to
customers at the same speed, regardless of the content. Opponents of
net neutrality would allow ISPs to charge companies to deliver some
websites faster, arguing that ISPs should be allowed to charge however
they like. Proponents of net neutrality argue that the Internet has
always had equal and unbiased access to information and that allowing
ISPs to vary access to websites based on content is a new form of
censorship. What do you think? Is net neutrality an important defense
of Internet freedom of speech, or is it government overreach looking to
hinder free markets?
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it illegal to
deactivate or otherwise disable any antipiracy technologies,
including DRM technologies. The act also establishes that
copies of commercial programs may not be legally resold or
given away. It further makes it a crime to sell or to use
programs or devices that are used to illegally copy software.
This may come as a surprise to those who copy software,
movies, or music from a friend or from the Internet. The law
is clear: It is illegal to copy or download copyright-
protected music and videos from the Internet without
appropriate authorization.
Today, there are many legal sources for digital media.
Television programs can be watched online, often for free, on
television-network-sponsored sites. Sites like 
Pandora allow listeners to enjoy music at no cost.
There are several online stores for purchasing music and
video content. A pioneer in this area is Apple’s iTunes
Music Store. (See Figure 9-14.)

Making IT work for you
SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY
The news is filled with instances of cybercrime. From
hacked e-mail to stolen identities, it’s a dangerous
digital world. Thankfully, there are a lot of precautions
you as an individual can and should take to make sure that
you aren’t the victim of high-tech criminals.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Here are some guidelines for keeping yourself safe from computer
crime.
Update software
Your operating system, web browser, and applications are constantly
improving to reduce the risk of malware infection. Be sure that your
devices are up to date. Look into the setting of your PC, tablet, and
phone—most devices have the option to check for software updates and
to opt in to automatically updating software.
Apple Inc.
Regularly back up your data
Criminals may infect your computer with ransomeware—software that
encrypts your data and demands a payment for the password to get the
data back. Without regular backups, you may lose data that can’t be
replaced—precious photos, important documents, and months of work on
projects. However, with a backup, you can restore your data within
minutes. Most operating systems offer automated cloud backups that are
easy to set up and effortless once in place.
Be careful when browsing
Always think before you click. Don’t download software from sites you
are not familiar with or don’t trust. Don’t assume that a pop-up
alert or warning is legitimate—scams and malware are often disguised
as legitimate plug-ins or updates. When updating software, use the
operating system’s app store.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Backblaze
Be alert to e-mail scams
E-mail scammers are notorious for trying to get people to send them
personal information that is then used to steal identities (phishing).
If you get an e-mail requesting money, a credit card number, a Social
Security number, a password, or any other personal information—be
very cautious—most reputable institutions will not request such
information by e-mail. Further, be careful opening e-mail or
attachments from strangers—this is a common way to spread Internet
viruses.
Use antivirus software

There are many free or inexpensive antivirus software packages
available. Be sure to update the antivirus software regularly (or
automate the update process) to make sure the software is up to date.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Google, INC.
Set up strong passwords
Common passwords, such as “password” or “love,” are a criminal’s
best friend. To make your passwords as secure as possible, do not use
common words or phrases and use a combination of lowercase and
uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers. You can also have secure
passwords suggested to you by a password management system—macOS
comes with Keychain and Internet browsers Google Chrome and Microsoft
Edge include password managers.
Protect against data breaches
A data breach is when criminals break into a company’s database and
sell or leak the account information found there. To reduce the risk
of having your accounts infiltrated by hackers, frequently change your
passwords, and do not reuse the same password on multiple accounts.
Enable two-factor authentication
Most security-minded applications or websites have the option for two-
factor authentication, especially online banking, financial services,
webmail, social media sites, and cloud services. However, you must
often go the extra step of enabling this process. Two-factor
authentication is one of the best ways to ensure that your privacy and
identity remain secure.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

ethics
Do you know of anyone who has copied parts of a web page from a variety
of sites and combined the parts to form a term paper? Of course, such a
practice is unethical and most likely illegal. Many schools and
universities now use a program that can compare the content of a
student’s paper to published material on the web and to previously
submitted papers. Do you think it is ethical for instructors to employ
a program that checks for plagiarism? Is there a risk that the program
may confuse proper citations from the web with obvious cases of
plagiarism?
Plagiarism
Another ethical issue is plagiarism, which means representing
some other person’s work and ideas as your own without
giving credit to the original source. Although plagiarism was
a problem long before the invention of computers, computer
technology has made plagiarism easier. For example, simply
cutting and pasting content from a web page into a report or
paper may seem tempting to an overworked student or employee.
Correspondingly, computer technology has made it easier
than ever to recognize and catch plagiarists. For example,
services such as Turnitin are dedicated to preventing
Internet plagiarism. This service will examine the content of
a paper and compare it to a wide range of known public
electronic documents, including web page content. In this
way, Turnitin can identify an undocumented paper or even
parts of an undocumented paper. (See Figure 9-15.)

IT security analysts are responsible for maintaining the
security of a company’s networks, systems, and data. Their
goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of information. These analysts must safeguard
information systems against a variety of external threats,
such as crackers and viruses, as well as be vigilant of
threats that may come from within the company.
Employers typically look for candidates with a
bachelor’s or associate’s degree in information systems
or computer science. Experience in this field or in network
administration is usually required. IT security analysts
should possess good communication and research skills and
be able to handle high-stress situations.
IT security analysts can expect to earn an annual salary
of $49,000 to $99,000. Opportunities for advancement
typically depend on experience. Demand for this position is
expected to grow as malware, crackers, and other types of
threats become more complex and prevalent.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
End of Anonymity
Do you use the Internet anonymously? Do you post photos or tweet without
revealing your name? Some people anonymously post horrible, dangerous, and
even criminal things on the Internet. Should anonymity protect us and
others from public scrutiny and possible criminal prosecution? Should we
sacrifice some or all of our anonymity for a safer, more civil discourse
on the web?
Have you ever thought about how your digital actions might be linked to
your real-world life? Imagine a future where your digital and real-world
lives blend, and neither has space for anonymous interaction. The Internet
has always had a challenging relationship with anonymity. Free speech
advocates praise anonymous speech, allowing citizens in oppressive regimes
to meet and share ideas without fear of government reprisal. In contrast,
security advocates argue that the same tools that allow for free speech in
dictatorships also allow terrorists to plan attacks against democracies.
In the future, we are likely to see an ever-decreasing level of anonymity.
Companies and Internet service providers already buy and sell your web
browsing habits and online purchase history to better advertise and sell
things to you. In the future, your browsing habits will likely follow you
into the real world, and your real-world actions will filter into your
digital persona.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In the future, when you visit a mall, security cameras will recognize
you and track your path using facial recognition and update your online
identity. This personal digital footprint will be continuously updated
based on social media postings, Internet browsing history, and credit card
purchases. Sensors in your clothes will tell stores what brands you like
and how much you spend.
Imagine, as computers analyze your path through the mall, a link is
made between your recent social media posts about your new exercise
routine. A sporting goods store just three shops ahead of you takes
notice. Instantly, your cell phone buzzes with a coupon for the store with
25 percent off for first-time customers. It may seem like coincidence, but
in a world without anonymity, there is no coincidence.
As you return home with your new treadmill, the sporting goods store
posts to your Facebook wall, congratulating you on your first steps to a
healthier you. It offers each of your Facebook friends a 20 percent off
coupon to join you in making healthy life choices. Your Internet-connected
treadmill posts your fitness progress on Twitter, describing the duration
and intensity of your workouts. Your web-connected scale shows the pounds
coming off. Your health insurance company, monitoring your scale’s
recordings, gives you a discount on your insurance rates based on your
lower weight. Your boss sees your treadmill posts and praises you at the
next meeting, encouraging other employees to learn from your example and
improve their lives through discipline and effort. However, this raises
the question: What will your boss think if you stop running on the
treadmill? Can you afford to add pounds on the scale if your insurance
rates will skyrocket? What do you think: Is this world without anonymity
better?

Acxiom
The three primary privacy issues: accuracy, property,
access.
Big Data
The ever-growing volume of data collected about us is
often referred to as big data. Information resellers
(information brokers) collect and sell personal data.
Mistaken identity occurs when the digital footprint
of one person is switched with another. The Freedom of
Information Act entitles individuals access to
governmental records relating to them.
Private Networks
Many organizations monitor employee e-mail and computer
files using special software called employee-monitoring
software.
The Internet and the Web
Many people believe that, while using the web, little can
be done to invade their privacy. This is called the
illusion of anonymity. The deep web is comprised of
websites that are hidden from standard search engines and
provide secure and anonymous communication. The dark web
is a part of the deep web comprised of sites that use
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
special software to hide their IP addresses, making it
nearly impossible to identify who is using it.
PRIVACY
Piotr Swat/Shutterstock
Information stored by browsers includes history files
(record of sites visited) and temporary Internet files
or browser cache (contain website content and display
instructions). Cookies store and track information.
Privacy mode (Private browsing) ensures that your
browsing activity is not recorded.
Spyware secretly records and reports Internet
activities. Keyloggers (one type of computer monitoring
software) records every activity and keystroke.
Antispyware (spy removal programs) detects and removes
various privacy threats.
Online Identity
Many people post personal information and sometimes
intimate details of their lives without considering the
consequences. This creates an online identity. With the
archiving and search features of the web, this identity
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
is indefinitely available to anyone who cares to look for
it.
Major Laws on Privacy
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protects personal financial
information, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects medical records, and
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
restricts disclosure of educational records.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of the potential impact of technology on
people. You need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable
about personal privacy, organizational security, and
ethics.
SECURITY
Michael Dwyer/Alamy Stock Photo
Computer security focuses on protecting information,
hardware, and software from unauthorized use as well as
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
preventing damage from intrusions, sabotage, and natural
disasters.
Cybercrime
Cybercrime (computer crime) is a criminal offense
involving a computer or network. (Cyberterrorism is a
politically motivated cybercrime.) Some types of
cybercrime are identity theft, Internet scams, data
manipulation, ransomware, denial of service (DoS)
attack, and distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack.
Social Engineering
Social engineering is the practice of manipulating
people to divulge private data. Phishing attempts to
trick people into believing a fake website is real.
Malicious Software
Crackers create and distribute malware (malicious
software). The three most common types are
Viruses migrate through networks and operating
systems; can alter and/or delete files.
Worms repeatedly replicate themselves, clogging
computers and networks.
Trojan horses appear harmless but contain malicious
programs.
SECURITY
Malicious Hardware
Cyber criminals can use computer hardware to steal
information. Three types of malicious hardware:
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Zombies—remotely controlled computers used for
malicious purposes; a collection is known as a botnet
(robot network).
Rogue Wi-Fi hotspots—network that appears to be a
legitimate free Wi-Fi hotspot. Once connected, any
input by users is captured.
Infected USB flash drives—USB drives that are often
free that contain a virus.
Measures to Protect Computer Security
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it a crime for
unauthorized persons to view data across state lines
using computers and prohibits unauthorized use of
computers owned by government or federally insured
financial institution. Ways to protect computer security
include limiting access, encrypting, and anticipating
disasters.
Access can be restricted through biometric scanning
devices and passwords (dictionary attacks use
thousands of words to attempt to gain access; Picture
Password uses series of gestures; facial recognition
limits access); security suites, firewalls, password
managers, and authentication (two-factor
authentication uses two types of data to verify your
identity; two-step authentication uses one type of
authentication twice).
Encrypting is coding information to make it unreadable
except to those who have the encryption key. Hypertext
transfer protocol secure (https) requires browsers and
websites to encrypt all messages. Virtual private
networks (VPNs) encrypt connections between company
networks and remote users. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected
Access) is the most widely used wireless network
encryption for home wireless networks.

A copyright is a legal concept that gives content
creators the right to control use and distribution of
their work. Materials that can be copyrighted include
paintings, books, music, films, and even video games.
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying and

topics are the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and
digital rights management.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it illegal

A simple online purchase requires a tremendous collection of carefully
planned and executed jobs. If you buy a some sports equipment online,
your purchase becomes part of a complex stream of information that allow
a company to succeed, employees to flourish, and you to get your sports
equipment. The ability to gather, analyze, and respond to data, like the
data generated when you make an online purchase, can mean the difference
between a company giving employees bonuses or layoff notices. The best
information systems automatically adjust to their environments and help
organizations react to current and future changes.

This chapter covers the things you need to know to be prepared for
this ever-changing digital world, including:
Organizational flow—identify how information flows within an
organization.
Computer-based information systems—recognize the levels of information
systems and how they help businesses make decisions.
Other information systems—understand expert systems and how you can
use them to make faster, smarter decisions.

Introduction
“Hi,

like to talk with you about how organizations use computer
information systems. I’d also like to talk about specialized

knowledge work systems that assist managers, engineers, and
scientists make decisions.”
An information system is a collection of people, procedures, software,
hardware, data, and connectivity (as we discussed in Chapter 1). They all
work together to provide information essential to running an organization.
This information is critical to successfully produce a product or service
and, for profit-oriented enterprises, to derive a profit.
Roman Samborskyi/Shutterstock
Why are computers used in organizations? At a basic level, computers
are used to record events. A computer will record the details of a sale
made in a store or update a database to recognize that an item sold has
reduced inventory. However, at a deeper level, computers are used to make
decisions. The data from sales in stores will decide employee bonuses. The
data about inventory items will identify market trends and affect what is
manufactured next season. In this chapter, you will learn how businesses
collect and use information to make decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers within an organization,
you need to understand how the information flows as it moves through an
organization’s different functional areas and management levels. You need
to be aware of the different types of computer-based information systems,
including transaction processing systems, management information systems,
decision support systems, and executive support systems. You also need to
understand the role and importance of databases to support each level or
type of information system.
Organizational Information Flow
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Computerized information systems do not just keep track of
transactions and day-to-day business operations. They also
support the vertical and horizontal flow of information
within the organization. To understand this, we need to
understand how an organization is structured. One way to
examine an organization’s structure is to view it from a
functional perspective. That is, you can study the different
basic functional areas in organizations and the different
types of people within these functional areas.
As we describe these, consider how they apply to a
hypothetical manufacturer of sporting goods, the HealthWise
Group. This company manufactures equipment for sports and
physical activities. Its products range from soccer balls to
yoga mats. (See Figure 10-1.)

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Like many organizations, HealthWise Group can be viewed
from a functional perspective with various management levels.
Effective operations require an efficient and coordinated
flow of information throughout the organization.
Functions
Depending on the services or products they provide, most
organizations have departments that specialize in one of five
basic functions. These are accounting, marketing, human
resources, production, and research. (See Figure 10-2.)

Accounting records all financial activity from billing
customers to paying employees. The HealthWise accounting
department tracks all sales, payments, and transfers of
funds. It also produces reports detailing the financial
condition of the company.
Marketing plans, prices, promotes, sells, and distributes
the organization’s goods and services. HealthWise’s goods
include a wide range of products related to sports and
other types of physical activity.
Human resources focuses on people—hiring, training,
promoting, and any number of other human-centered
activities within the organization. At HealthWise, human
resources is responsible for implementing a new benefits
package, for hiring new skilled workers, and much more.
Production actually creates finished goods and services
using raw materials and personnel. HealthWise manufacturers
a variety of sports equipment, including yoga mats.
Research identifies, investigates, and develops new
products and services. For example, at HealthWise,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
scientists are investigating a light, inexpensive alloy for
a new line of weight-training equipment.
Figure 10-2 The five functions of an organization
Description

Although the titles may vary, nearly every large and small
organization has departments that perform these basic
functions. Whatever your job in an organization, it is likely
to be in one of these functional areas.
Management Levels
The foundation of any organization is not managers, but the
employees who produce goods and services. These employees are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the base of the organizational pyramid and consist of
assemblers, painters, welders, drivers, and others. Above
them are various levels of managers—people with titles such
as supervisor, director, regional manager, and vice
president. These are the people who do the planning, leading,
organizing, and controlling necessary to see that the work
gets done.
For example, the northwest district sales manager for
HealthWise directs and coordinates all the salespeople in her
area. Other job titles might be vice president of marketing,
director of human resources, or production manager. In
smaller organizations, these titles are often combined.
Management in many organizations is divided into three
levels. These levels are supervisors, middle management, and
top management. (See Figure 10-3.)
Supervisors: Supervisors manage and monitor the employees
or workers. Thus, these managers have responsibility
relating to operational matters. They monitor day-to-day
events and immediately take corrective action, if
necessary.
Middle management: Middle-level managers deal with
control, planning (also called tactical planning), and
decision making. They implement the long-term goals of the
organization.
Top management: Top-level managers are concerned with
long-range planning (also called strategic planning). They
need information that will help them plan the future growth
and direction of the organization.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 10-3 Three levels of management
Description

Information Flow
Each level of management has different information needs.
Top-level managers need summary information describing the
overall operations of the business. They also need
information from outside the organization because top-level
managers need to forecast and plan for long-range events.
Middle-level managers need summarized information—weekly or
monthly reports. They need to develop budget projections and
to evaluate the performance of supervisors. Supervisors need
detailed, very current, day-to-day information on their units
so that they can keep operations running smoothly. (See
Figure 10-4.)

To support these different needs, information flows in
different directions. (See Figure 10-5.) For top-level
managers, the flow of information from within the
organization is both vertical and horizontal. The top-level
managers, such as the chief executive officer (CEO), need
information from below and from all departments. They also
need information from outside the organization. For example,
HealthWise is deciding whether to introduce a line of fitness
trackers in the southwestern United States. The vice
president of marketing must look at relevant data. Such data
might include the number of people currently using the
HealthWise fitness app and census data about the number of
young people. It also might include sales histories on
related fitness monitoring equipment.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 10-5 Information flow within an organization
Description
For middle-level managers, the HealthWise information flow
is both vertical and horizontal across functional lines. For
example, the regional sales managers set their sales goals by
coordinating with middle managers in the production
department. They are able to tell sales managers what
products will be produced, how many, and when. The regional
sales managers also must coordinate with the strategic goals
set by the top managers. They must set and monitor the sales
goals for the supervisors beneath them.

For supervisory managers, information flow is primarily
vertical. That is, supervisors communicate mainly with their
middle managers and with the workers beneath them. For
instance, at HealthWise, production supervisors rarely
communicate with people in the accounting department.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
However, they are constantly communicating with production-
line workers and with their own managers.
Now we know how many organizations are structured and how
information flows within the organization. But how is a
computer-based information system likely to be set up to
support its needs? And what do you need to know to use it?

Computer-Based Information
Systems
Almost all organizations have computer-based information
systems. Large organizations typically have formal names for
the systems designed to collect and use the data. Although
different organizations may use different names, the most
common names are transaction processing, management
information, decision support, and executive support systems.
(See Figure 10-6.)

Figure 10-6 Types of computer-based information systems
Description
Transaction processing system: The transaction processing
system (TPS) records day-to-day transactions, such as
customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production
output. The TPS helps supervisors by generating databases
that act as the foundation for the other information
systems.
Management information system: The management information
system (MIS) summarizes the detailed data of the
transaction processing system in standard reports for
middle-level managers. Such reports might include weekly
sales and production schedules.
Decision support system: The decision support system
(DSS) provides a flexible tool for analysis. The DSS helps
middle-level managers and others in the organization
analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of
events and trends outside the organization. Like the MIS,
the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction
processing system.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Executive support system: The executive support system
(ESS), also known as the executive information system
(EIS), is an easy-to-use system that presents information
in a very highly summarized form. It helps top-level
managers oversee the company’s operations and develop
strategic plans. The ESS combines the databases generated
from the TPS and the reports generated from the MIS with
external data.

Transaction Processing Systems
A transaction processing system (TPS) helps an organization
keep track of routine operations and records these events in
a database. For this reason, some firms call this the data
processing system (DPS). The data from operations—for
example, customer orders for HealthWise’s products—makes up
a database that records the transactions of the company. This
database of transactions is used to support the MIS, DSS, and
ESS.
One of the most essential transaction processing systems
for any organization is in the accounting area. (See Figure
10-7.) Every accounting department handles six basic
activities. Five of these are sales order processing,
accounts receivable, inventory and purchasing, accounts
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
payable, and payroll. All of these are recorded in the
general ledger, the sixth activity.
Figure 10-7 Transaction processing system for accounting

Let us take a look at these six activities. They will make
up the basis of the accounting system for almost any
organization you might work in.
The sales order processing activity records the customer
requests for the company’s products or services. At
HealthWise when an order comes in—a request for a set of
barbells, for example—the warehouse is alerted to ship a
product.
The accounts receivable activity records money received
from or owed by customers. HealthWise keeps track of bills
paid by sporting goods stores and by gyms and health clubs
to which it sells directly.
The parts and finished goods that the company has in stock
are called inventory. At HealthWise this would include all
exercise machines, footballs, soccer balls, and yoga mats
ready for sale in the warehouse. (See Figure 10-8.) An
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
inventory control system keeps records of the number of
each kind of part or finished good in the warehouse.
Purchasing is the buying of materials and services.
Often a purchase order is used. This is a form that shows
the name of the company supplying the material or service
and what is being purchased.
Accounts payable refers to money the company owes its
suppliers for materials and services it has received. At
HealthWise this would include materials such as steel and
aluminum used to manufacture its exercise equipment.
The payroll activity is concerned with calculating employee
paychecks. Amounts are generally determined by the pay
rate, hours worked, and deductions (such as taxes, Social
Security, medical insurance). Paychecks may be calculated
from employee time cards or, in some cases, supervisors’
time sheets.
The general ledger keeps track of all summaries of all the
foregoing transactions. A typical general ledger system can
produce income statements and balance sheets. Income
statements show a company’s financial performance—income,
expenses, and the difference between them for a specific
time period. Balance sheets list the overall financial
condition of an organization. They include assets (for
example, buildings and property owned), liabilities
(debts), and how much of the organization (the equity) is
owned by the owners.

teller machines, which record cash withdrawals; online
registration systems, which track student enrollments; and
supermarket discount cards, which track customer purchases.

Management Information Systems
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
A management information system (MIS) is a computer-based
information system that produces standardized reports in
summarized structured form. (See Figure 10-9.) It is used to
support middle managers. An MIS differs from a transaction
processing system in a significant way. Whereas a transaction
processing system creates databases, an MIS uses databases.
Indeed, an MIS can draw from the databases of several
departments. Thus, an MIS requires a database management
system that integrates the databases of the different
departments. Middle managers often need summary data drawn
from across different functional areas.
Figure 10-9 Management information system report
An MIS produces reports that are predetermined. That is,
they follow a predetermined format and always show the same
kinds of content. Although reports may differ from one
industry to another, there are three common categories of
reports: periodic, exception, and demand.
Periodic reports are produced at regular intervals—weekly,
monthly, or quarterly, for instance. Examples are
HealthWise’s monthly sales and production reports. The
sales reports from district sales managers are combined
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
into a monthly report for the regional sales managers. For
comparison purposes, a regional manager is also able to see
the sales reports of other regional managers.
Exception reports call attention to unusual events. An
example is a sales report that shows that certain items are
selling significantly above or below marketing department
forecasts. For instance, if fewer exercise bicycles are
selling than were predicted for the northwest sales region,
the regional manager will receive an exception report. That
report may be used to alert the district managers and
salespeople to give this product more attention.
The opposite of a periodic report, a demand report is
produced on request. An example is a report on the numbers
and types of jobs held by women and minorities. Such a
report is not needed periodically, but it may be required
when requested by the U.S. government. At HealthWise, many
government contracts require this information. It is used
to certify that HealthWise is within certain government
equal-opportunity guidelines.

Describe the three common categories of MIS reports.

Decision Support Systems
Managers often must deal with unanticipated questions. For
example, the Health-Wise manager in charge of manufacturing
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
might ask how an anticipated labor strike would affect
production schedules. A decision support system (DSS)
enables managers to get answers to such unexpected and
generally nonrecurring kinds of problems.
A DSS is quite different from a transaction processing
system, which simply records data. It is also different from
a management information system, which summarizes data in
predetermined reports. A DSS is used to analyze data.
Moreover, it produces reports that do not have a fixed
format. This makes the DSS a flexible tool for analysis.
A DSS must be easy to use—or most likely it will not be
used at all. A HealthWise marketing manager might want to
know which territories are not meeting their monthly sales
quotas. To find out, the executive could ask or query the
sales database for all “SALES < QUOTA.” (See Figure 10-10.)
Figure 10-10 Decision support system query results for
SALES < QUOTA

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
How does a decision support system work? Essentially, it
consists of four parts: the user, system software, data, and
decision models.
The user could be you. In general, the user is someone who
has to make decisions—a manager, often a middle-level
manager.
System software is essentially the operating system—
programs designed to work behind the scenes to handle
detailed operating procedures. In order to give the user a
good, intuitive interface, the software typically is menu
or icon driven. That is, the screen presents easily
understood lists of commands or icons, giving the user
several options.
Data in a DSS is typically stored in a database and
consists of two kinds. Internal data—data from within the
organization—consists principally of transactions from the
transaction processing system. External data is data
gathered from outside the organization. Examples are data
provided by marketing research firms, trade associations,
and the U.S. government (such as customer profiles, census
data, and economic forecasts).
Decision models give the DSS its analytical capabilities.
There are three basic types of decision models: strategic,
tactical, and operational. Strategic models assist top-
level managers in long-range planning, such as stating
company objectives or planning plant locations. 
Tactical models help middle-level managers control
the work of the organization, such as financial planning

lower-level managers accomplish the organization’s day-to-

What is the purpose of a decision support system?
Describe the four parts of a DSS.
Identify three basic types of decision models.
Executive Support Systems
Using a DSS requires some training. Many top managers have
other people in their offices running DSSs and reporting
their findings. Top-level executives also want something more
concise than an MIS—something that produces very focused
reports.Executive
support systems (ESSs) consist of sophisticated
software that, like an MIS or a DSS, can present, summarize,
and analyze data from an organization’s databases. However,
an ESS is specifically designed to be easy to use. This is so
that a top executive with little spare time, for example, can
obtain essential information without extensive training.
Thus, information is often displayed in a very condensed form
with informative graphics.
Consider an executive support system used by the president
of HealthWise. It is available on his personal computer. The
first thing each morning, the president calls up the ESS on
his display screen, as shown in Figure 10-11. Note that the
screen gives a condensed account of activities in the five
different areas of the company. (These are Accounting,
Marketing, Production, Human Resources, and Research.) On
this particular morning, the ESS shows business in four areas
proceeding smoothly. However, in the first area, Accounting,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the percentage of late-paying customers—past due accounts—
has increased by 3 percent. Three percent may not seem like
much, but HealthWise has had a history of problems with late
payers, which has left the company at times strapped for
cash. The president decides to find out the details. To do
so, he selects 1. Accounting.

Within moments, the display screen displays a graph of the
past due accounts. (See Figure 10-12.) The status of today’s
late payers is shown in red. The status of late payers at

this time a year ago is shown in yellow. The differences
between today and a year ago are significant and clearly
presented. For example, approximately $60,000 was late 1 to
10 days last year. This year, over $80,000 was late. The
president knows that he must take some action to speed up
customer payments. (For example, he might call this to the
attention of the vice president of accounting. The vice
president might decide to implement a new policy that offers
discounts to early payers or charge higher interest to late
payers.)

Description
ESSs permit a firm’s top executives to gain direct access
to information about the company’s performance. Most provide
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
direct electronic communication links to other executives. In
addition, some ESSs have the ability to retrieve information
from databases outside the company, such as business-news
services. This enables a firm to watch for stories on
competitors and stay current on relevant news events that
could affect its business. For example, news of increased
sports injuries caused by running and aerobic dancing, and
the consequent decrease in people’s interest in these
activities, might cause HealthWise to alter its sales and
production goals for its line of fitness-related shoes.
For a summary of the different types of information
systems, see Figure 10-13.
Type Description
TPS Tracks routine operations and records events in databases; also known
as data processing systems
MIS Produces standardized reports (periodic, exception, and demand) using
databases created by TPS
DSS Analyzes unanticipated situations using data (internal and external)
and decision models (strategic, tactical, and operational)
ESS Presents summary information in a flexible, easy-to-use, graphical
format designed for top executives

Other Information Systems
We have discussed only four information systems: TPSs to
support lower-level managers, MISs and DSSs to support
middle-level managers, and ESSs to support top-level
managers. There are many other information systems to support
different individuals and functions. The fastest growing are
information systems designed to support information workers.
Information workers distribute, communicate, and create
information. They are the organization’s administrative
assistants, clerks, engineers, and scientists, to name a few.
Some are involved with distribution and communication of
information (like administrative assistants and clerks; see
Figure 10-14). They are called data workers. Others are
involved with the creation of information (like the engineers
and scientists). They are called knowledge workers.

Two systems to support information workers are
Office automation systems: Office automation systems
(OASs) are designed primarily to support data workers.
These systems focus on managing documents, communicating,
and scheduling. Documents are managed using word
processing, web authoring, desktop publishing, and other
image technologies. Project managers are programs designed
to schedule, plan, and control project resources. Microsoft
Project is the most widely used project manager.
Videoconferencing systems are computer systems that allow
people located at various geographic locations to
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
communicate and have in-person meetings. (See Figure 10-
15.)
Knowledge work systems: Knowledge workers use OAS systems.
Additionally, they use specialized information systems
called knowledge work systems (KWSs) to create information
in their areas of expertise. For example, engineers
involved in product design and manufacturing use computer-
aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
systems. (See Figure 10-16.) These KWSs consist of powerful
personal computers running special programs that integrate
the design and manufacturing activities. CAD/CAM is widely
used in the manufacture of automobiles and other products.

system.

Expert Systems
People who are expert in a particular area—certain kinds of
medicine, accounting, engineering, and so on—are generally
well paid for their specialized knowledge. Unfortunately for
their clients and customers, these experts are expensive and
not always available.
What if you were to somehow capture the knowledge of a
human expert and make it accessible to everyone through a
computer program? This is exactly what is being done with
expert systems. Expert systems, also known as knowledge-
based systems, are a type of artificial intelligence that
uses a database to provide assistance to users. This
database, known as a knowledge base, contains facts and rules
to relate these facts distilled from a human expert. Users
interact with an expert system by describing a particular
situation or problem. The expert system takes the inputs and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
searches the knowledge base until a solution or
recommendation is formulated. Expert systems are highly
specialized software built by experienced professionals in
their field. Industries where expert systems are popular
include medicine, geology, architecture, and nature.

Information systems managers oversee the work of
programmers, computer specialists, systems analysts, and
other computer professionals. They create and implement
corporate computer policy and systems.
Most companies look for individuals with strong
technical backgrounds, sometimes as consultants, with a
master’s degree in business. Employers seek individuals
with strong leadership and excellent communication skills.
Information systems managers must be able to communicate
with people in technical and nontechnical terms.
Information systems management positions are often filled
by individuals who have been consultants or managers in
previous positions. Those with experience in computer and
network security will be in demand as businesses and
society continue to struggle with important security
issues.
Information systems managers can expect an annual salary
of $90,430 to $208,000. Advancement opportunities typically
include leadership in the field.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
IBM’s Watson: The Ultimate Information-Finding
Machine
Have you noticed how much information is out there, from books and
journals in your library to the millions of articles on the web? Do you
ever wonder how professionals manage to read through all that research in
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
order to stay up to date in their field? Recently, as the amount of
information increases, those professionals are finding it difficult to
keep up. In the future, IBM hopes to change that through its information-
finding supercomputer known as Watson. Technology has been making better
information tools, and will continue to evolve to improve our lives as we
look to the future.
In 2011, Watson made headlines by defeating the two best contestants in
the game show Jeopardy. What made the achievement so remarkable was that
the computer had to read the question, understand what was being asked,
search through 200 million pages of text, figure out what the best answer
would be, and then hit a buzzer before the other contestants to deliver
the answer. It accomplished all these steps in about 3 seconds.
With this skill, IBM predicts that Watson could be the ultimate
researcher, helping professionals in various industries find the
information they are looking for in a matter of seconds. Several
organizations have already “hired” Watson. One healthcare company will
be using Watson to help suggest options based on a patient’s unique
circumstances. It assists physicians and nurses by looking through
millions of pages of medical research and then quickly identifying the
most likely diagnosis and treatment options for the patient. To help
Watson learn more about the medical field, IBM has partnered with a cancer
center in order to “teach” Watson how to process the massive amount of
cancer-related research and case studies. In the finance field, Watson has
recently been learning about the complexities of Wall Street, with the
hopes that it can help financial firms identify risks and rewards to
improve the advice given to their customers.

In the future, IBM envisions Watson’s technology being an integral
part of these two industries. In addition, it sees practical applications
in call centers and technical support services. Countless organizations
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
and consumers would all benefit if access to this type of information
technology became widespread. It would transform the way all of us do
research and seek answers for our toughest problems.
Since Watson’s debut, many other companies have developed similar
systems. Ride-sharing company Uber uses Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive
Services to verify the identity of its drivers. The United Kingdom’s
National Health Services uses Quill, developed by Narrative Science, to
analyze medical research documents and patient data to assist medical
doctors in treating patients. They also use DeepMind, developed by Google,
to analyze medical test results and to propose specific treatment options
for patients.
What do you think about these powerful services? Do you think you could
one day have access to this powerful technology on your favorite search
engine? How about at home? Do you believe it will be a beneficial support
tool or a machine that threatens to take jobs away from professionals?

ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Information flows in an organization through functional
areas and between management levels.
Functions
Most organizations have separate departments to perform
five functions:
Accounting—tracks all financial activities and
generates periodic financial statements.
Marketing—advertises, promotes, and sells the product
(or service).
Production—makes the product (or service) using raw
materials and people to turn out finished goods.
Human resources—finds and hires people; handles such
matters as sick leave, retirement benefits, evaluation,
compensation, and professional development.
Research—conducts product research and development;
monitors and troubleshoots new products.
Management Levels
The three basic management levels are
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Top level—concerned with long-range planning and
forecasting.
Middle level—deals with control, planning, decision
making, and implementing long-term goals.
Supervisors—control operational matters, monitor day-
to-day events, and supervise workers.
Information Flow
Information flows within an organization in different
directions.
For top-level managers, the information flow is
primarily upward from within the organization and into
the organization from the outside.
For middle-level managers, the information flow is
horizontal and vertical within departments.
For supervisors, the information flow is primarily
vertical.

To efficiently and effectively use computers within an
organization, you need to understand how information
flows through functional areas and management levels.
You need to be aware of the different types of
computer-based information systems, including
transaction processing systems, management information
systems, decision support systems, and executive
support systems.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Transaction Processing Systems
Transaction processing systems (TPSs), sometimes called
data processing systems (DPSs), record day-to-day
transactions. Accounting activities include sales order
processing, accounts receivable, inventory and
purchasing, accounts payable, payroll, and general
ledger. A general ledger is used to produce income
statements and balance sheets.
Management Information Systems
Management information systems (MISs) produce
predetermined reports (periodic, exception, demand).
Decision Support Systems
Decision support systems (DSSs) focus on unanticipated
questions; consist of the user, system software, data
(internal and external), and decision models. Three
types are strategic, tactical, and operational. Group
decision support systems (GDSS) support a team of
decision makers.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Executive Support Systems
Executive support systems (ESSs) are similar to MIS or
DSS but easier to use. ESSs are designed specifically for
top-level decision makers.
Other Information Systems
Many other systems are designed to support information
workers who create, distribute, and communicate
information. Three such systems are
Office automation systems (OASs), which support data
workers who are involved with distribution and
communication of information. Project managers and
videoconferencing systems are OASs.
Knowledge work systems (KWSs), which support
knowledge workers, who create information. Many
engineers use computer-aided design/computer-aided
manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.
Expert (knowledge-based) systems, which are a type of
knowledge work system. They use knowledge bases to
apply expert knowledge to specific user problems.
CAREERS in IT
Information systems managers oversee a variety of other
computer professionals. Strong leadership and
communication skills are required; experience as a
consultant and/or manager is desired. Expected salary
range is $90,430 to $208,000.

Like a library, secondary storage is designed to store information. How is
this stored information organized? What are databases, and why do you need
to know anything about them?
Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island with
only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, through
communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct
electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.
In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They
are an important part of nearly every organization, including schools,
hospitals, and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need
to know how to find information and understand how it is stored.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
data fields, records, tables, and databases. You need to be aware of the
different ways in which a database can be structured and the different
types of databases. Also, you need to know the most important database
uses and issues.
Data
As we have discussed throughout this book, information
systems consist of people, procedures, software, hardware,
data, and the Internet. This chapter focuses on data, which
can be defined as facts or observations about people, places,
things, and events. More specifically, this chapter focuses
on how databases store, organize, and use data.
Not long ago, data was limited to numbers, letters, and
symbols recorded by keyboards. Now, data is much richer and
includes
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Audio captured, interpreted, and saved using microphones
and voice recognition systems.
Music downloaded from the Internet and saved on cell
phones, tablets, and other devices.
Photographs captured by digital cameras, edited by image
editing software, and shared with others over the Internet.
Video captured by digital video cameras, TV tuner cards,
and webcams.
There are two ways, or perspectives, to view data. These
perspectives are the physical view and the logical view. The
physical view focuses on the actual format and location of
the data. As discussed in Chapter 5, data is recorded as
digital bits that are typically grouped together into bytes
that represent characters using a coding scheme such as
Unicode. Typically, only very specialized computer
professionals are concerned with the physical view. The other
perspective, the logical view, focuses on the meaning,
content, and context of the data. End users and most computer
professionals are concerned with this view. They are involved
with actually using the data with application programs. This
chapter presents the logical view of data and how data is
stored in databases.

Data Organization
The first step in understanding databases is to learn how
data is organized. In the logical view, data is organized
into groups or categories. Each group is more complex than
the one before. (See Figure 11-1.)
Character: A character is the most basic logical data
element. It is a single letter, number, or special
character, such as a punctuation mark, or a symbol, such as
$.
Field: The next higher level is a field, or group of
related characters. In our example, Brown is in the data
field for the Last Name of an employee. It consists of the
individual letters (characters) that make up the last name.
A data field represents an attribute (description or
characteristic) of some entity (person, place, thing, or
object). For example, an employee is an entity with many
attributes, including his or her last name.
Record: A record is a collection of related fields. A
record represents a collection of attributes that describe
an entity. In our example, the payroll record for an
employee consists of the data fields describing the
attributes for one employee. These attributes are First
Name, Last Name, Employee ID, and Salary.
Table: A table is a collection of related records. For
example, the Payroll Table would include payroll
information (records) for the employees (entities).
Database: A database is an integrated collection 
of logically related tables. For example, the
Personnel Database would include all related employee
tables, including the Payroll Table and the Benefits Table.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 11-1 Logical data organization
Description
Key Field
Each record in a table has at least one distinctive field,
called the key field. Also known as the primary key, this
field uniquely identifies the record. Tables can be related
or connected to other tables by common key fields.
For most employee databases, a key field is an employee
identification number. Key fields in different tables can be
used to integrate the data in a database. For example, in the
Personnel Database, both the Payroll and the Benefits tables
include the field Employee ID. Data from the two tables could
be related by combining all records with the same key field
(Employee ID).
Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways. These
are batch processing, or what we might call “later,” and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
real-time processing, or what we might call “now.” These
two methods have been used to handle common record-keeping
activities such as payroll and sales orders.
Batch processing: In batch processing, data is collected
over several hours, days, or even weeks. It is then
processed all at once as a “batch.” If you have a credit
card, your bill probably reflects batch processing. That
is, during the month, you buy things and charge them to
your credit card. Each time you charge something, an
electronic copy of the transaction is sent to the credit
card company. At some point in the month, the company’s
data processing department puts all those transactions (and
those of many other customers) together and processes them
at one time. The company then sends you a single bill
totaling the amount you owe. (See Figure 11-2.)
Real-time processing: Real-time processing, also 
known as online processing, occurs when data is
processed at the same time the transaction occurs. For
example, whenever you request funds at an ATM, real-time
processing occurs. After you have provided account
information and requested a specific withdrawal, the
bank’s computer verifies that you have sufficient funds in
your account. If you do, then the funds are dispensed to
you, and the bank immediately updates the balance of your
account. (See Figure 11-3.)

person. For example, a customer’s name and address could
appear in different files within the sales department,
billing department, and credit department. This is called
data redundancy. If the customer moves, then the address in
each file must be updated. If one or more files are
overlooked, problems will likely result. For example, a
product ordered might be sent to the new address, but the
bill might be sent to the old address. This situation results
from a lack of data integrity.

Moreover, data spread around in different files is not as
useful. The marketing department, for instance, might want to
offer special promotions to customers who order large
quantities of merchandise. To identify these customers, the
marketing department would need to obtain permission and
access to files in the billing department. It would be much
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
more efficient if all data were in a common database. A
database can make the needed information available.
Need for Databases
For an organization, there are many advantages to having
databases:
Sharing: In organizations, information from one department
can be readily shared with others. Billing could let
marketing know which customers ordered large quantities of
merchandise.
Security: Users are given passwords or access only to the
kind of information they need. Thus, the payroll department
may have access to employees’ pay rates, but other
departments would not.
Less data redundancy: Without a common database,
individual departments have to create and maintain their
own data, and data redundancy results. For example, an
employee’s home address would likely appear in several
files. Redundant data causes inefficient use of storage
space and data maintenance problems.
Data integrity: When there are multiple sources of data,
each source may have variations. A customer’s address may
be listed as “Main Street” in one system and “Main St.”
in another. With discrepancies like these, it is probable
that the customer would be treated as two separate people.
Database Management
In order to create, modify, and gain access to a database,
special software is required. This software is called a
database management system, which is commonly abbreviated
DBMS.
Some DBMSs, such as Microsoft Access, are designed
specifically for personal computers. Other DBMSs are designed
for specialized database servers. DBMS software is made up of
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
five parts or subsystems: DBMS engine, data definition, data
manipulation, application generation, and data
administration.
The DBMS engine provides a bridge between the logical view
of the data and the physical view of the data. When users
request data (logical perspective), the DBMS engine handles
the details of actually locating the data (physical
perspective).
The data definition subsystem defines the logical
structure of the database by using a data dictionary or
schema. This dictionary contains a description of the
structure of data in the database. For a particular item of
data, it defines the names used for a particular field. It
defines the type of data for each field (text, numeric,
time, graphic, audio, and video). An example of an Access
data dictionary form is presented in Figure 11-4.
The data manipulation subsystem provides tools for
maintaining and analyzing data. Maintaining data is known
as data maintenance. It involves adding new data, deleting
old data, and editing existing data. Analysis tools support
viewing all or selected parts of the data, querying the
database, and generating reports. Specific tools include
query-by-example and a specialized programming language
called structured query language (SQL). (Structured query
language and other types of programming languages will be
discussed in Chapter 13.)
The application generation subsystem provides tools to
create data entry forms and specialized programming
languages that interface or work with common and 
widely used programming languages such as C++ or
Visual Basic. See Figure 11-5 for a data entry form created
by the application generation subsystem in Access.
The data administration subsystem helps to manage the
overall database, including maintaining security, providing
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
disaster recovery support, and monitoring the overall
performance of database operations. Larger organizations
typically employ highly trained computer specialists,
called database administrators (DBAs), to interact with
the data administration subsystem. Additional duties of
database administrators include determining processing
rights or determining which people have access to what
kinds of data in the database.

DBMS Structure
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
DBMS programs are designed to work with data that is
logically structured or arranged in a particular way. This
arrangement is known as the database model. These models
define rules and standards for all the data in a database.
For example, Microsoft Access is designed to work with
databases using the relational data model. Five common
database models are hierarchical, network, relational,
multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
At one time, nearly every DBMS designed for mainframes used
the hierarchical data model. In a hierarchical database,
fields or records are structured in nodes. Nodes are points
connected like the branches of an upside-down tree. Each
entry has one parent node, although a parent may have several
child nodes. This is sometimes described as a one-to-many
relationship. To find a particular field, you have to start
at the top with a parent and trace down the tree to a child.
The nodes farther down the system are subordinate to the
ones above, like the hierarchy of managers in a corporation.
An example of a hierarchical database is a system to organize
music files. (See Figure 11-6.) The parent node is the music
library for a particular user. This parent has 
four children, labeled “artist.” Coldplay, one
of the children, has three children of its own. They are
labeled “album.” The Greatest Hits album has three
children, labeled “song.”
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 11-6 Hierarchical database
Description
The problem with a hierarchical database is that if one
parent node is deleted, so are all the subordinate child
nodes. Moreover, a child node cannot be added unless a parent
node is added first. The most significant limitation is the
rigid structure: one parent only per child, and no
relationships or connections between the child nodes
themselves.
Network Database
Responding to the limitations of the hierarchical data model,
network models were developed. A network database also has a
hierarchical arrangement of nodes. However, each child node
may have more than one parent node. This is sometimes
described as a many-to-many relationship. There are
additional connections—called pointers—between parent nodes
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
and child nodes. Thus, a node may be reached through more
than one path. It may be traced down through different
branches.
For example, a university could use this type of
organization to record students taking classes. (See Figure
11-7.) If you trace through the logic of this organization,
you can see that each student can have more than one teacher.
Each teacher also can teach more than one course. Students
may take more than a single course. This demonstrates how the
network arrangement is more flexible and, in many cases, more
efficient than the hierarchical arrangement.
Figure 11-7 Network database
Description
Relational Database
The most common type of organization is the relational
database. In this structure, there are no access paths down a
hierarchy. Rather, the data elements are stored in different
tables, each of which consists of rows and columns. A table
and its data are called a relation.
An example of a relational database is shown in Figure 11-
8. The Vehicle Owner Table contains license numbers, names,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
and addresses for all registered drivers. Within the table, a
row is a record containing information about one driver. Each
column is a field. The fields are License Number, Last Name,
First Name, Street, City, State, and Zip. All related tables
must have a common data item, or shared key field, in both
tables, enabling information stored in one table to be linked
with information stored in another. In this case, the three
tables are related by the License Number field.

Police officers who stop a speeding car look up the
driver’s information in the Department of Motor Vehicles
database (Figure 11-9) using the driver’s license number.
They also can check for any unpaid traffic violations in the
Outstanding Citations Table. Finally, if the officers suspect
that the car is stolen, they can look up what vehicles the
driver owns in the Vehicle Table.

The most valuable feature of relational databases is their
simplicity. Entries can be easily added, deleted, and
modified. The hierarchical and network databases are more
rigid. The relational organization is common for personal
computer DBMSs such as Access. Relational databases are also
widely used for mainframe and midrange systems.
Multidimensional Database
The multidimensional data model is a variation and an
extension of the relational data model. Whereas relational
databases use tables consisting of rows and columns,
multidimensional databases extend this two-dimensional data
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
model to include additional or multiple dimensions, sometimes
called a data cube. Data can be viewed as a cube having three
or more sides and consisting of cells. Each side of the cube
is considered a dimension of the data. In this way, complex
relationships between data can be represented and efficiently
analyzed.

Multidimensional databases provide several advantages over
relational databases. Two of the most significant advantages
are
Conceptualization: Multidimensional databases and data
cubes provide users with an intuitive model in which
complex data and relationships can be analyzed without
specialized database programming knowledge.
Processing speed: Analyzing and querying a large
multidimensional database can be much faster. For example,
a query requiring just a few seconds on a multidimensional
database could take minutes or hours to perform on a
relational database.
Object-Oriented Database
The other data structures are primarily designed to access
and summarize structured data such as names, addresses, pay
rates, and so on. Object-oriented databases are more
flexible and store data as well as instructions to manipulate
the data. Additionally, this structure is ideally designed to
provide input for object-oriented software development, which
is described in Chapter 13.
Object-oriented databases organize data using classes,
objects, attributes, and methods.
Classes are general definitions.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Objects are specific instances of a class that can contain
both data and instructions to manipulate the data.
Attributes are the data fields an object possesses.
Methods are instructions for retrieving or manipulating
attribute values.
For example, a health club might use an object-oriented
employment database. (See Figure 11-10.) The database uses a
class, Employee, to define employee objects that are stored
in the database. This definition includes the attributes
First name, Last name, Address, and Wage and the method Pay.
Bob, Sarah, and Omar are objects each with specific
attributes designated by their object type. For example, Bob
is an employee and an accountant. Bob has attributes common
to all employees, such as a name and address. He also has
attributes unique to accountants, such as his certification
as a public accountant. Different objects use different
methods to determine some information. For example,
accountants earn an annual salary, while salespeople earn an
hourly wage as well as a commission.

Types of Databases
Databases may be small or large, limited in accessibility or
widely accessible. Databases may be classified into four
types: individual, company, distributed, and commercial.
Individual
The individual database is also called a personal computer
database. It is a collection of integrated files primarily
used by just one person. Typically, the data and the DBMS are
under the direct control of the user. They are stored either
on the user’s hard-disk drive or on a LAN file server.
There may be many times in your life when you will find
this kind of database valuable. If you are in sales, for
instance, a personal computer database can be used to keep
track of your customers. If you are a sales manager, you can
keep track of your salespeople and their performance. If you
are an advertising account executive, you can keep track of
your different projects and how many hours to charge each
client.
Company
Companies, of course, create databases for their own use. The
company database may be stored on a central database server
and managed by a database administrator. Users throughout the
company have access to the database through their personal
computers linked to local or wide area networks.
As we discussed in Chapter 10, company databases are the
foundation for management information systems. For instance,
a department store can record all sales transactions in the
database. A sales manager can use this information to see
which salespeople are selling the most products. The manager
can then determine year-end sales bonuses. Or the store’s
buyer can learn which products are selling well or not
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
selling and make adjustments when reordering. A top executive
might combine overall store sales trends with information
from outside databases about consumer and 
population trends. This information could be used
to change the whole merchandising strategy of the store.
Distributed
Many times the data in a company is stored not in just one
location but in several locations. It is made accessible
through a variety of communications networks. The database,
then, is a distributed database. That is, not all the data
in a database is physically located in one place. Typically,
database servers on a client/server network provide the link
between the data.
For instance, some database information can be at regional
offices. Some can be at company headquarters, some down the
hall from you, and some even overseas. Sales figures for a
chain of department stores, then, could be located at the
various stores. But executives at district offices or at the
chain’s headquarters could have access to all these figures.
Commercial
A commercial database is generally an enormous database that
an organization develops to cover particular subjects. It
offers access to this database to the public or selected
outside individuals for a fee. Sometimes commercial databases
also are called information utilities or data banks. An
example is Factiva, which offers a variety of information-
gathering and reporting services. (See Figure 11-12.)

technical and scientific information.
Dow Jones Factiva—provides world news and information on
business, investments, and stocks.
LexisNexis—offers news and information on legal news,
public records, and business issues.
Most of the commercial databases are designed for
organizational as well as individual use. Organizations
typically pay a membership fee plus hourly use fees. Often,
individuals are able to search the database to obtain a
summary of available information without charge. They pay
only for those items selected for further investigation.
See Figure 11-13 for a summary of the four types of
databases.

Database Uses and Issues
Databases offer great opportunities for productivity. In
fact, in corporate libraries, electronic databases are now
considered more valuable than books and journals. However,
maintaining databases means users must make constant efforts
to keep them from being tampered with or misused.
Strategic Uses
Databases help users to keep up to date and to plan for the
future. To support the needs of managers and other business
professionals, many organizations collect data from a variety
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
of internal and external databases. This data is then stored
in a special type of database called a data warehouse. A
technique called data mining is often used to search these
databases to look for related information and patterns.
Hundreds of databases are available to help users with
both general and specific business purposes, including
Business directories providing addresses, financial and
marketing information, products, and trade and brand names.
Demographic data, such as county and city statistics,
current estimates on population and income, employment
statistics, census data, and so on.
Business statistical information, such as financial
information on publicly traded companies, market potential
of certain retail stores, and other business data and
information.
Text databases providing articles from business
publications, press releases, reviews on companies and
products, and so on.
Web databases covering a wide range of topics, including
all of those previously mentioned. As mentioned earlier,
web search sites like Google maintain extensive databases
of available Internet content.
Security
Precisely because databases are so valuable, their security
has become a critical issue. As we discussed in Chapter 9,
there are several database security concerns. One concern is
that personal and private information about people stored in
databases may be used for the wrong purposes. For 
instance, a person’s credit history or medical
records might be used to make hiring or promotion decisions.
Another concern is unauthorized users gaining access to a
database. For example, there have been numerous instances in
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
which a computer virus has been launched into a database or
network.
Security may require putting guards in company computer
rooms and checking the identification of everyone admitted.
Some security systems electronically check fingerprints. (See
Figure 11-14.) Security is particularly important to
organizations using WANs. Violations can occur without
actually entering secured areas. As mentioned in previous
chapters, most major corporations today use special hardware
and software called firewalls to control access to their
internal networks.

Database administrators use database management software
to determine the most efficient ways to organize and access
a company’s data. Additionally, database administrators
are typically responsible for maintaining database security
and backing up the system. Database administration is a
fast-growing industry, and substantial job growth is
expected.
Database administrator positions normally require a
bachelor’s degree in computer science or information
systems and technical experience. Internships and prior
experience with the latest technology are a considerable
advantage for those seeking jobs in this industry. It is
possible to transfer skills learned in one industry, such
as finance, to a new career in database administration. In
order to accomplish this objective, many people seek
additional training in computer science.
Database administrators can expect to earn an annual
salary of $47,000 to $111,000. Opportunities for

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The Future of Crime Databases
Have you ever imagined a world without violent crime? What would you be
willing to do (or give up) if your government could guarantee that all
potential criminals could be stopped before they commit their crime?
Recently, we are close to making this possible through large and powerful
databases, along with computer programs that can analyze data and make
predictions. The tricky part is that the databases require a significant
amount of personal information from everyone who lives in the country.
Technology has been making better crime databases and will continue to
evolve to improve our lives as we look to the future.
Currently, national crime databases in several countries, such as the
United States, focus on keeping data about individuals that have committed
crimes. Not only do these databases contain basic information such as name
and date of birth, they also contain fingerprints, photos, and even DNA
samples. This makes it easier to figure out who committed a crime after it
happens, assuming the criminal is already in the database. Although the
offender will eventually be caught, it is too late for the innocent
victim. For this reason, researchers are currently looking into the
possibility of expanding the collection of data and then using powerful
programs to figure out who is capable of committing violent crimes in the
future.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Over the last few years, various research institutions have been
looking into patterns that could predict criminal behavior. They analyze
data ranging from childhood abuse to current employment status. Their goal
is to find a combination of factors that usually leads to violent,
criminal behavior. Other researchers are looking deep into human DNA,
looking for any sequences that could be connected to antisocial or violent
behavior. If such patterns could be found, then all we need to do is find
the individuals who have these characteristics. The problem is that not
all these individuals have an entry in the national crime database.
Furthermore, these databases do not contain data about every aspect of a
person’s life. That, however, could change.
Over the years, criminal databases have been expanding. However, in the
United States, each state has the ability to determine the data to be
collected and from whom it will be collected. Whereas one state might take
a DNA sample from only violent criminals and sex offenders, another state
might collect that data from someone who committed a misdemeanor. If a
future crime database is to make predictions, law enforcement will have to
take DNA samples from every person living in the United States.
Furthermore, the government will need access to all databases that contain
information about that person—including databases from schools,
businesses, insurance companies, and medical practices. Only then can
these future programs be able to predict which individuals have the sort
of patterns that may lead to future criminal behavior. Once those
individuals are spotted, law enforcement could be authorized to monitor
them closely or perhaps even intervene with psychological or medical
assistance.
Supposing a crime-predicting program could be developed, there will be
legal challenges to the type of data collection required. Individuals will
be asked to weigh their privacy against the possibility of reducing crime.
Inevitably, our trust of the government will also come into play. What do
you think about this sort of future database? Would you trust the
reset

government with all this personal and biological information? Do you
believe it is worth giving up privacy for the sake of having security?

VISUAL SUMMARY
Databases
DATA ORGANIZATION
Data is organized by the following groups:
Character—the most basic logical element, consisting
of individual numbers, letters, and special characters.
Field—next level, consisting of a set of related
characters, for example, a person’s last name. A data
field represents an attribute (description or
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
characteristic) of some entity (person, place, thing,
or object).
Record—a collection of related fields; for example, a
payroll record consisting of fields of data relating to
one employee.
Table—a collection of related records; for example, a
payroll table consisting of all the employee records.
Database—an integrated collection of related tables;
for example, a personnel database contains all related
employee tables.
Key Field
A key field (primary key) is the field in a record that
uniquely identifies each record.
Tables can be related (connected) to other tables by
key fields.
Key fields in different files can be used to integrate
the data in a database.
Common key fields are employee ID numbers and driver’s
license numbers.
DATA ORGANIZATION
Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways:
batch or real-time processing.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Batch processing—data is collected over time and then
processed later all at one time (batched). For example,
monthly credit card bills are typically created by
processing credit card purchases throughout the past
month.
Real-time processing (online processing)—data is
processed at the same time the transaction occurs;
direct access storage devices make real-time processing
possible. For example, a request for cash using an ATM
machine initiates a verification of funds, approval or
disapproval, disbursement of cash, and an update of the
account balance.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand data fields, records, tables, and
databases. You need to be aware of the different ways
in which a database can be structured and the different
types of databases. Also, you need to know the most
important database uses and issues.

Need for Databases
Advantages of databases are sharing data, improved
security, reduced data redundancy, and higher data
integrity.
Database Management
A database management system (DBMS) is the software for
creating, modifying, and gaining access to the database.
A DBMS consists of five subsystems:
DBMS engine provides a bridge between logical and
physical data views.
Data definition subsystem defines the logical
structure of a database using a data dictionary or
schema.
Data manipulation subsystem provides tools for data
maintenance and data analysis; tools include query-by-

languages.
Data administration subsystem manages the database;
database administrators (DBAs) are computer
professionals who help define processing rights.
DBMS STRUCTURE
DBMS programs are designed to work with specific data
structures or database models. These models define rules
and standards for all the data in the database. Five
principal database models are hierarchical, network,
relational, multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
Hierarchical database uses nodes to link and structure
fields and records; entries may have one parent node
with several child nodes in a one-to-many relationship.
Network Database
Network database is like hierarchical except a child
node may have more than one parent in a many-to-many
relationship; additional connections are called
pointers.
Relational Database

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Relational database data is stored in tables
(relations); related tables must have a common data item

Multidimensional databases extend two-dimensional
relational tables to three or more dimensions, sometimes

Object-oriented databases store data, instructions, and
unstructured data. Data is organized using

When an organization designs and implements a new system, jobs are on the
line. A well-designed system can make a career; a poor one can destroy a
company. Systems analysis and design details the framework for creating
new systems. In the future, information systems will rely on cloud-based
services, giving easier upgrades, improved security, and higher
reliability.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Marie, and I’m a systems analyst. I’d like to talk
with you about analyzing and designing information systems for
organizations.”

Most people in an organization are involved with an information system of
some kind. For an organization to create and effectively use a system
requires considerable thought and effort. Fortunately, there is a six-step
process for accomplishing this. It is known as systems analysis and
design.
Big organizations can make big mistakes. For example, a large
automobile manufacturer once spent $40 billion putting in factory robots
and other high technology in its automaking plants. Unfortunately, the
manufacturer could never make these new changes work and removed much of
the equipment and reinstalled its original production systems. Why did the
high-tech production systems fail? The probable reason was that not enough
energy was devoted to training its workforce in using the new systems.
The government also can make big mistakes. In one year, the Internal
Revenue Service computer system was so overwhelmed it could not deliver
tax refunds on time. How did this happen? Despite extensive testing of
much of the system, not all testing was completed. Thus, when the new
system was phased in, the IRS found it could not process tax returns as
quickly as it had hoped.
Both of these examples show the necessity for thorough planning—
especially when an organization is trying to implement a new kind of
system. Systems analysis and design reduces the chances for such
spectacular failures.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the importance of systems analysis and design. You need to be aware of the
relationship of an organization’s chart to its managerial structure.
Additionally, you need to know the six phases of the systems development
life cycle: preliminary investigation, systems analysis, systems design,
systems development, systems implementation, and systems maintenance.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems Analysis and Design
A system is a collection of activities and elements organized
to accomplish a goal. As we saw in Chapter 10, an information
system is a collection of hardware, software, people,
procedures, data, and the Internet. These work together to
provide information essential to running an organization.
This information helps produce a product or service and, for
profit-oriented businesses, derive a profit.
Information about orders received, products shipped, money
owed, and so on flows into an organization from the outside.
Information about what supplies have been received, which
customers have paid their bills, and so on also flows within
the organization. To avoid confusion, the flow of information
must follow a route that is defined by a set of rules and
procedures. However, from time to time, organizations need to
change their information systems. Reasons include
organizational growth, mergers and acquisitions, new
marketing opportunities, revisions in governmental
regulations, and availability of new technology.

Systems analysis and design is a six-phase problem-
solving procedure for examining and improving an information
system. The six phases make up the systems life cycle. (See
Figure 12-1.) The phases are as follows:
. Preliminary investigation: The organization’s problems or
needs are identified and summarized in a short report.
. Systems analysis: The present system is studied in depth.
New requirements are specified and documented.
. Systems design: A new or alternative information system is
designed and a design report created.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
. Systems development: New hardware and software are
acquired, developed, and tested.
. Systems implementation: The new information system is
installed, and people are trained to use it.
. Systems maintenance: In this ongoing phase, the system is
periodically evaluated and updated as needed.
Figure 12-1 The six-phase systems life cycle
In organizations, this six-phase systems life cycle is
used by computer professionals known as systems analysts.
These people study an organization’s systems to determine
what actions to take and how to use computer technology to
assist them.
As an end user, working alone or with a systems analyst,
it is important that you understand how the systems life
cycle works. In fact, you may have to use the procedure.
Every career is affected by information systems, and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
understanding how they are created and used will allow you to
work smarter and avoid common mistakes.
There are many misconceptions about the life cycle of an
information system. Those unfamiliar with the life cycle
model are likely to consider the design, development, and
implementation phases as the most important. However, many
information systems fail because of a lack of investigation
and analysis. Further, many information systems go over
budget or become obsolete too quickly because of a failure to
recognize the importance of system maintenance. It can be a
thankless task, insisting that design and development be
delayed to ensure that investigation and analysis be done
throughly. Further, inexperienced developers, in an effort to
save money, will look to reduce or underestimate maintenance
expenses. However, the long-term success of an information
system is dependent on understanding the value and necessity
of each of the phases.
Learning the six steps described in this chapter will
raise your computer efficiency and effectiveness. It also
will give you skills to solve a wide range of problems. These
skills can make you more valuable to an organization.

What is a system?
Name the six phases of the systems life cycle.
What do systems analysts do?

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Phase 1: Preliminary
Investigation
The first phase of the systems life cycle is a preliminary
investigation of a proposed project to determine the need for
a new information system. This usually is requested by an end
user or a manager who wants something done that is not
presently being done. For example, suppose you work for
Advantage Advertising, a fast-growing advertising agency.
Advantage Advertising produces a variety of different ads for
a wide range of different clients. The agency employs both
regular staff workers and on-call freelancers. One of your
responsibilities is keeping track of the work performed for
each client and the employees who performed the work. In
addition, you are responsible for tabulating the final bill
for each project.
How do you figure out how to charge which clients for
which work done by which employees? This kind of problem is
common to many service organizations (such as lawyers’ and
contractors’ offices). Indeed, it is a problem in any
organization where people charge for their time and clients
need proof of hours worked.
In Phase 1, the systems analyst—or the end user—is
concerned with three tasks: (1) briefly defining the problem,
(2) suggesting alternative solutions, and (3) preparing a
short report. (See Figure 12-2.) This report will help
management decide whether to pursue the project further. (If
you are an end user, you may not produce a written report.
Rather, you might report your findings directly to your
supervisor.)
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 12-2 Phase 1: Preliminary investigation
Defining the Problem
Defining the problem means examining whatever current
information system is in use. Determining what information is
needed, by whom, when, and why is accomplished by
interviewing and making observations. If the information
system is large, this survey is done by a systems analyst. If
the system is small, the survey can be done by the end user.
For example, suppose Advantage Advertising account
executives, copywriters, and graphic artists currently record
the time spent on different jobs on their desk calendars.
(Examples might be “Client A, telephone conference, 15
minutes”; “Client B, design layout, 2 hours.”) After
interviewing several account executives and 
listening to their frustrations, it becomes clear
that the approach is somewhat disorganized. (See Figure 12-
3.) Written calendar entries are too unprofessional to be
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
shown to clients. Moreover, a large job often has many people
working on it. It is difficult to pull together all their
notations to make up a bill for the client. Some freelancers
work at home, and their time slips are not readily available.
These matters constitute a statement of the problem: The
company has a manual time-and-billing system that is slow and
difficult to use.
Figure 12-3 One step in defining problems with the current
system is to interview executives
ESB Professional/Shutterstock
As an end user, you might experience difficulties with
this system yourself. You’re in someone else’s office, and
a telephone call comes in for you from a client. Your desk
calendar is back in your own office. You have two choices.
You can always carry your calendar with you, or you can
remember to note the time you spent on various tasks when you
return to your office. The administrative assistant reporting
to the account executive is continually after you (and
everyone else at Advantage) to provide photocopies of your
calendar. This is so that various clients can be billed for
the work done on various jobs. Surely, you think, there must
be a better way to handle time and billing.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Suggesting Alternative Systems
This step is simply to suggest some possible plans as
alternatives to the present arrangement. For instance,
Advantage could hire more administrative assistants to
collect the information from everyone’s calendars (including
telephoning those working at home). Or it could use the
existing system of network-linked personal computers that
staffers and freelancers presently use. Perhaps, you think,
there is already some off-the-shelf packaged software
available that could be used for a time-and-billing system.
At least there might be one that would make your own job
easier.
Preparing a Short Report
For large projects, the systems analyst writes a report
summarizing the results of the preliminary investigation and
suggesting alternative systems. The report also may include
schedules for further development of the project. This
document is presented to higher management, along with a
recommendation to continue or discontinue the project.
Management then decides whether to finance the second phase,
the systems analysis.
For Advantage Advertising, your report might point out
that billing is frequently delayed. It could say that some
tasks may even “slip through the cracks” and not get
charged at all. Thus, as the analyst has noted, you suggest
the project might pay for itself merely by eliminating lost
or forgotten charges.

Phase 2: Systems Analysis
In Phase 2, systems analysis, data is collected about the
present system. This data is then analyzed, and new
requirements are determined. We are not concerned with a new
design here, only with determining the requirements for a new
system. Systems analysis is concerned with gathering and
analyzing the data. This usually is completed by documenting
the analysis in a report. (See Figure 12-4.)
Figure 12-4 Phase 2: Systems analysis
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Gathering Data
When gathering data, the systems analyst—or the end user
doing systems analysis—expands on the data gathered during
Phase 1. He or she adds details about how the current system
works. Data is obtained from observation and interviews. In
addition, data may be obtained from questionnaires given to
people using the system. Data also is obtained from studying
documents that describe the formal lines of authority and
standard operating procedures. One such document is the
organization chart, which shows levels of management as well
as formal lines of authority.
Analyzing the Data
In the data analysis step, the idea is to learn how
information currently flows and to pinpoint why it isn’t
flowing appropriately. The whole point of this step is to
apply logic to the existing arrangement to see how workable
it is. Many times, the current system is not operating
correctly because prescribed procedures are not being
followed. That is, the system may not really need to be
redesigned. Rather, the people in it may need to be shown how
to follow correct procedures.
Many different tools are available to assist systems
analysts and end users in the analysis phase. Some of the
most important are the top-down analysis method, grid charts,
system flowcharts, data flow diagrams, and automated design
tools.
Top-down analysis method: The top-down analysis method is
used to identify the top-level components of a complex
system. Each component is then broken down into smaller and
smaller components. This approach makes each component
easier to analyze and deal with.

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
For instance, the systems analyst might look at the
present kind of bill submitted to a client for a complex
advertising campaign. The analyst might note the categories
of costs—employee salaries, telephone and mailing charges,
travel, supplies, and so on.
Grid charts: A grid chart shows the relationship between
input and output documents. An example is shown in Figure
12-5 that indicates the relationship between the data input
and the outputs.
For instance, a time sheet is one of many inputs that
produces a particular report, such as a client’s bill.
Other inputs might be forms having to do with telephone
conferences and travel expenses. On a grid sheet, rows
represent inputs, such as time sheet forms. Columns
represent output documents, such as different clients’
bills. A check mark at the intersection of a row and column
means that the input document is used to create the output
document.
System flowcharts: System flowcharts show the flow of
input data to processing and finally to output, or
distribution of information. An example of a system
flowchart keeping track of time for advertising “creative
people” is shown in Figure 12-6. The explanation of the
symbols used appears in Figure 12-7. Note that this
describes the present manual, or noncomputerized, system.
(A system flowchart is not the same as a program flowchart,
which is very detailed. Program flowcharts are discussed in
Chapter 13.)
Data flow diagrams: Data flow diagrams show the data or
information flow within an information system. The data is
traced from its origin through processing, storage, and
output. An example of a data flow diagram is shown in
Figure 12-8. The explanation of the symbols used appears in
Figure 12-9.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Automated design tools: Automated design tools are
software packages that evaluate hardware and software
alternatives according to requirements given by the systems
analyst. They are also called computer-aided software
engineering (CASE) tools. These tools are not limited to
systems analysis. They are used in systems design and
development as well. CASE tools relieve the systems
analysts of many repetitive tasks, develop clear
documentation, and, for larger projects, coordinate team
member activities.

Documenting Systems Analysis
In larger organizations, the systems analysis stage is
typically documented in a report for higher management. The
systems analysis report describes the current information
system, the requirements for a new system, and a possible
development schedule. For example, at Advantage Advertising,
the system flowcharts show the present flow of information in
a manual time-and-billing system. Some boxes in the system
flowchart might be replaced with symbols showing where a
computerized information system could work better.
Management studies the report and decides whether to
continue with the project. Let us assume your boss and higher
management have decided to continue. You now move on to Phase
3, systems design.

Phase 3: Systems Design
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Phase 3 is systems design. It consists of three tasks: (1)
designing alternative systems, (2) selecting the best system,
and (3) writing a systems design report. (See Figure 12-10.)
Figure 12-10 Phase 3: Systems design
Designing Alternative Systems
In almost all instances, more than one design can be
developed to meet the information needs. Systems designers
evaluate each alternative system for feasibility. By
feasibility we mean three things:
Economic feasibility: Will the costs of the new system be
justified by the benefits it promises? How long will it
take for the new system to pay for itself?
Technical feasibility: Are reliable hardware, 
software, and training available to make the system
work? If not, can they be obtained?
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Operational feasibility: Can the system actually be made
to operate in the organization, or will people—employees,
managers, clients—resist it?
Selecting the Best System
When choosing the best design, managers must consider these
four questions: (1) Will the system work with the
organization’s overall information system? (2) Will the
system be flexible enough so it can be modified in the
future? (3) Can it be made secure against unauthorized use?
(4) Are the benefits worth the costs?
For example, one aspect you have to consider at Advantage
Advertising is security. Should freelancers and outside
vendors enter data directly into a computerized time-and-
billing system, or should they keep submitting time sheets
manually? In allowing these outside people to input
information directly, are you also allowing them access to
files they should not see? Do these files contain
confidential information, perhaps information of value to
rival advertising agencies?
Writing the Systems Design Report
The systems design report is prepared for higher management
and describes the alternative designs. It presents the costs
versus the benefits and outlines the effect of alternative
designs on the organization. It usually concludes by
recommending one of the alternatives.

Phase 4: Systems Development
Phase 4 is systems development. It has three steps: (1)
acquiring software, (2) acquiring hardware, and (3) testing
the new system. (See Figure 12-11.)
Figure 12-11 Phase 4: Systems development
Acquiring Software
Application software for the new information system can be
obtained in two ways. It can be purchased as off-the-shelf
packaged software and possibly modified, or it can be custom-
designed. If any of the software is being specially created,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the programming steps we will outline in Chapter 13 should be
followed.
With the systems analyst’s help, you have looked at time-
and-billing packaged software designed for service
organizations. Unfortunately, you find that none of the
packaged software will do. Most of the packages seem to work
well for one person (you). However, none seems to be designed
for many people working together. It appears, then, that
software will have to be custom-designed. (We discuss the
process of developing software in Chapter 13, on
programming.)
Acquiring Hardware
Some new systems may not require new computer equipment, but
others will. The equipment needed and the places where they
are to be installed must be determined. This is a very
critical area. Switching or upgrading equipment can be a
tremendously expensive proposition. Will a personal computer
system be sufficient as a company grows? Are networks
expandable? Will people have to undergo costly training?
The systems analyst tells you that there are several
different makes and models of personal computers currently in
use at Advantage Advertising. Fortunately, all are connected
by a local area network to a file server that can hold the
time-and-billing data. To maintain security, the systems
analyst suggests that an electronic mailbox be installed for
freelancers and others outside the company. They can use this
electronic mailbox to post their time charges. Thus, it
appears that existing hardware will work just fine.

Testing the New System
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
After the software and equipment have been installed, the
system should be tested. Sample data is fed into the system.
The processed information is then evaluated to see whether
results are correct. Testing may take several months if the
new system is complex.
For this step, you ask some people in Creative Services to
test the system. (See Figure 12-12.) You observe that some of
the people have problems knowing where to enter their times.
To solve the problem, the software is modified to display an
improved user entry screen. After the system has been
thoroughly tested and revised as necessary, you are ready to
put it into use.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Phase 5: Systems Implementation
Another name for Phase 5, systems implementation, is
conversion. It is the process of changing—converting—from
the old system to the new one and training people to use the
new system.
Types of Conversion
There are four approaches to conversion: direct, parallel,
pilot, and phased.
In the direct approach, the conversion is done simply by
abandoning the old and starting up the new. This can be
risky. If anything is still wrong with the new system, the
old system is no longer available to fall back on.
The direct approach is not recommended precisely because
it is so risky. Problems, big or small, invariably crop up
in a new system. In a large system, a problem might just
mean catastrophe.
In the parallel approach, old and new systems are operated
side by side until the new one proves to be reliable.
This approach is low risk. If the new system fails, the
organization can just switch to the old system to keep
going. However, keeping enough equipment and people active
to manage two systems at the same time can be very
expensive. Thus, the parallel approach is used only in
cases in which the cost of failure or of interrupted
operation is great.
In the pilot approach, the new system is tried out in only
one part of the organization. Once the system is working
smoothly in that part, it is implemented throughout the
rest of the organization.
The pilot approach is certainly less expensive than the
parallel approach. It also is somewhat riskier. However,
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the risks can be controlled because problems will be
confined to only certain areas of the organization.
Difficulties will not affect the entire organization.
In the phased approach, the new system is 
implemented gradually over a period of time. The
entire implementation process is broken down into parts or
phases. Implementation begins with the first phase, and
once it is successfully implemented, the second phase
begins. This process continues until all phases are
operating smoothly. Typically, this is an expensive
proposition because the implementation is done slowly.
However, it is certainly one of the least risky approaches.
In general, the pilot and phased approaches are the
favored methods. Pilot is preferred when there are many
people in an organization performing similar operations—for
instance, all salesclerks in a department store. Phased is
more appropriate for organizations in which people are
performing different operations.
You and the systems analyst, with top management support,
have decided on a pilot implementation. This approach was
selected in part based on cost and the availability of a
representative group of users. The Creative Services
department previously tested the system and has expressed
enthusiastic support for it. A group from this department
will pilot the implementation of the time-and-billing system.
Training
Training people is important, of course. Unfortunately, it is
one of the most commonly overlooked activities. Some people
may begin training early, even before the equipment is
delivered, so that they can adjust more easily. In some
cases, a professional software trainer may be brought in to
show people how to operate the system. However, at Advantage
Advertising, the time-and-billing software is simple enough
that the systems analyst can act as the trainer.

Briefly describe the four approaches to conversion.
Which two conversion approaches are favored methods?
Phase 6: Systems Maintenance
After implementation comes systems maintenance, the last
step in the systems life cycle. This phase is a very
important, ongoing activity. Most organizations spend more
time and money on this phase than on any of the others.
Maintenance has two parts: a systems audit and a periodic
evaluation.
In the systems audit, the system’s performance is
compared to the original design specifications. This is to
determine whether the new procedures are actually furthering
productivity. If they are not, some redesign may be
necessary.
After the systems audit, the new information system is
further modified, if necessary. All systems should be
evaluated from time to time to determine whether they are
meeting the goals and providing the service they are supposed
to.
The six-step systems life cycle is summarized in Figure
12-13.

Prototyping and Rapid
Applications
Development
Is it necessary to follow every phase of the systems life
cycle? It may be desirable, but often there is no time to do
so. For instance, hardware may change so fast that there is
no opportunity for evaluation, design, and testing as just
described. Two alternative approaches that require much less
time are prototyping and rapid applications development.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can be
modified before the actual system is installed. For instance,
the systems analyst for Advantage Advertising might develop a
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
proposed or prototype menu as a possible screen display for
the time-and-billing system. Users would try it out and
provide feedback to the systems analyst. The systems analyst
would revise the prototype until the users felt it was ready
to put into place. Typically, the development time for
prototyping is shorter; however, it is sometimes more
difficult to manage the project and to control costs. (See
Figure 12-14.)

Rapid Applications Development
Rapid applications development (RAD) involves the use of
powerful development software, small specialized teams, and
highly trained personnel. For example, the systems analyst
for Advantage Advertising would use specialized development
software like CASE, form small teams consisting of select
users and managers, and obtain assistance from other highly
qualified analysts. Although the resulting time-and-billing
system would likely cost more, the development time would be
shorter and the quality of the completed system would be
better.

Careers in IT
“Now
that you have learned about systems analysis and design,
let me tell you about my career as a systems analyst.”
Ridofranz/Getty Images
A systems analyst follows the steps described in the
systems life cycle. Analysts plan and design new systems or
reorganize a company’s computer resources to best utilize
them. Analysts follow the systems life cycle through all of
its steps: preliminary investigation, analysis, design,
development, implementation, and maintenance.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems analyst positions normally require either an
advanced associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree in
computer science or information systems and technical
experience. Internships and prior experience with the
latest technology are a considerable advantage for those
seeking jobs in this industry. Systems analysts can expect
to earn an annual salary of $48,000 to $95,000.
Opportunities for advancement include positions as a chief
technology officer or other managerial opportunities.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The Challenge of Keeping Pace
Have you noticed the speed with which new (or competing) products and
services are being released? Does your favorite website change often to
keep up with its competitors? Most observers firmly believe that the pace
of business is accelerating. The time to develop a product and bring it to
market, in many cases, is now months rather than years. Internet
technologies, in particular, have provided tools to support the rapid
introduction of new products and services. Technology has been making
better business tools, and will continue to evolve to improve our lives as
we look to the future.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

To stay competitive, corporations must integrate these new technologies
into their existing ways of doing business. In many cases, the traditional
systems life cycle approach takes too long—sometimes years—to develop a
system. Many organizations are responding by aggressively implementing
prototyping and RAD. Others are enlisting the services of outside
consulting groups that specialize in systems development. However, many
experts believe that the future of life cycle management lies in relying
on the cloud—businesses will turn to companies that offer both processing
and software as a service, rather than hosting these systems on their own.
In the future, many companies will no longer have large servers and
database systems under their own roof. They will instead pay a monthly fee
to a company, such as Amazon, that has large data centers that are
accessible via the Internet. These data centers offer security and
reliability, and they can grow, or scale, based on the needs of the
business. The systems analyst of the future will not have to worry about
the hardware requirements of a new piece of software or database
management system. The implementation of new systems will be much easier,
for both the business and its customers. All hardware upgrades will now be
managed by the company offering the cloud service, and the software will
be hosted there. Of course, all this requires a good communications
infrastructure—one that is being improved each year by telecommunications
companies.
What do you think about moving so many aspects of a system to the
cloud? Is there a danger in trusting another company with your business’s
data? Do you think cloud computing will enable a business to release
reliable products more quickly and at a lower cost?

Systems Analysis
VISUAL SUMMARY
and Design
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
A system is a collection of activities and elements
organized to accomplish a goal. Systems analysis and
design is a six-phase problem-solving procedure that
makes up the systems life cycle. The phases are
Preliminary investigation—identifying organization’s
problems or needs and summarizing in short report.
Systems analysis—studying present system in depth,
specifying new requirements, and documenting findings.
Systems design—designing new or alternative system to
meet new requirements and creating a design report.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems development—acquiring, developing, and testing
needed hardware and software.
Systems implementation—installing new system and
training people.
Systems maintenance—periodically evaluating and
updating system as needed.
Systems analysts are the computer professionals who
typically follow the six-phase systems life cycle.
PHASE 1: PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
The preliminary investigation determines the need for a
new information system. It is typically requested by an
end user or a manager. Three tasks of this phase are
defining the problem, suggesting alternative systems, and
preparing a short report.
Defining the Problem
The current information system is examined to determine
who needs what information, when the information is
needed, and why it is needed.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If the existing information system is large, then a
systems analyst conducts the survey. Otherwise, the end
user conducts the survey.
Suggesting Alternative Systems
Some possible alternative systems are suggested. Based on
interviews and observations made in defining the problem,
alternative information systems are identified.
Preparing a Short Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 1,
preliminary investigation, a short report is prepared and
presented to management.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand the importance of systems analysis and
design. You need to know the six phases of the systems
development life cycle: preliminary investigation,
analysis, design, development, implementation, and
maintenance. Additionally, you need to understand
prototyping and RAD.
PHASE 2: SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In systems analysis, data is collected about the present
system. The focus is on determining the requirements for
a new system. Three tasks of this phase are gathering
data, analyzing the data, and documenting the analysis.
Gathering Data
Data is gathered by observation, interviews,
questionnaires, and looking at documents. One helpful
document is the organization chart, which shows a
company’s functions and levels of management.
Analyzing the Data
There are several tools for the analysis of data,
including top-down analysis, grid charts, and system
flowcharts.
Documenting Systems Analysis
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 2, a
systems analysis report is prepared for higher
management.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: SYSTEMS DESIGN
In the systems design phase, a new or alternative
information system is designed. This phase consists of
three tasks:
Designing Alternative Systems
Alternative information systems are designed. Each
alternative is evaluated for
Economic feasibility—cost versus benefits; time for
the system to pay for itself.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Technical feasibility—hardware and software
reliability; available training.
Operational feasibility—will the system work within
the organization?
Selecting the Best System
Four questions should be considered when selecting the
best system:
Will the system fit into an overall information system?
Will the system be flexible enough to be modified as
needed in the future?
Will it be secure against unauthorized use?
Will the system’s benefits exceed its costs?
Writing the Systems Design Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 3, a
systems design report is prepared for higher management.

PHASE 4: SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In the systems development phase, software and hardware
are acquired and tested.
Acquiring Software
Two ways to acquire software are purchasing off-the-shelf
packaged software and designing custom programs.
Acquiring Hardware
Acquiring hardware involves consideration for future
company growth, existing networks, communication
capabilities, and training.
Testing the New System
Using sample data, the new system is tested. This step
can take several months for a complex system.

PHASE 5: SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION
Systems implementation, also known as conversion, is
the process of changing to the new system and training
people.
Types of Conversion
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Four ways to convert are direct, parallel, pilot, and
phased approaches.
Direct approach—abandoning the old system and
starting up the new system; can be very risky and not
recommended.
Parallel approach—running the old and new side by
side until the new system proves its worth; very low
risk; however, very expensive; not generally
recommended.
Pilot approach—converting only one part of the
organization to the new system until the new system
proves its worth; less expensive but riskier than
parallel conversion; recommended for situations with
many people performing similar operations.
Phased approach—gradually implementing the new system
to the entire organization; less risky but more
expensive than parallel conversion; recommended for
situations with many people performing different
operations.
Training
Training is important, but often overlooked. Some people
may train early as the equipment is being delivered so
that they can adjust more easily. Sometimes a
professional trainer is used; other times the systems
analyst acts as the trainer.

PHASE 6: SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems maintenance consists of a systems audit followed
by periodic evaluation.
Systems Audit
Once the system is operational, the systems analyst
performs a systems audit by comparing the new system to
its original design specifications.
Periodic Evaluation
The new system is periodically evaluated to ensure that
it is operating efficiently.
Phase Activity

Due to time pressures, it is not always feasible to
follow every phase of the systems life cycle. Two
alternatives that require less time are prototyping and
RAD.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can
be modified before the actual system is installed.
Typically, the development time for prototyping is
shorter; however, it can be more difficult to manage the
project and to control costs.
Rapid Applications Development

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Rapid applications development (RAD) uses powerful
development software, small specialized teams, and highly
trained personnel. Typically, the development costs more.
However, the time is much less and the quality is often
better.
CAREERS in IT
Systems analysts plan and design new systems or
reorganize a company’s computer resources to better
utilize them. They follow the systems life cycle through
all its steps. Either an advanced associate’s degree or
a bachelor’s degree in computer science or information
systems and technical experience are required. Expected
salary range is $48,000 to $95,000.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Alice, and I’m a computer programmer. I’d like to
talk with you about programming and programming languages.”
In the previous chapter, we discussed systems analysis and design. We
discussed the six-phase systems life cycle approach for examining and
improving an information system. One of the phases is systems development,
or the acquisition of new hardware and software. This chapter relates to
this phase, systems development. More specifically, this chapter focuses
on developing new software or programming. We will describe programming in
two parts: (1) the steps in the programming process and (2) some of the
programming languages available.

Why should you need to know anything about programming? The answer is
simple. You might need to deal with programmers in the course of your
work. You also may be required to do some programming yourself in the
future. A growing trend is toward end-user software development. This
means that end users, like you, are developing their own application
programs.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the relationship between systems development and programming.
Additionally, you need to know the six steps of programming, including
program specification, program design, program code, program test, program
documentation, and program maintenance.
Programs and Programming
What exactly is programming? Many people think of it as
simply typing words into a computer. That may be part of it,
but that is certainly not all of it. Programming, as we’ve
hinted before, is actually a problem-solving procedure.
What Is a Program?
To see how programming works, think about what a program is.
A program is a list of instructions for the computer to
follow to accomplish the task of processing data into
information. The instructions are made up of statements used
in a programming language, such as C++, Java, or Python.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
You are already familiar with some types of programs. As
we discussed in Chapters 1 and 3, application programs are
widely used to accomplish a variety of different types of
tasks. For example, we use word processors to create
documents and spreadsheets to analyze data. These can be
purchased and are referred to as prewritten or packaged
programs. Programs also can be created or custom-made. In
Chapter 12, we saw that the systems analyst looked into the
availability of time-and-billing software for Advantage
Advertising. Will off-the-shelf software do the job, or
should it be custom-written? This is one of the first things
that needs to be decided in programming.
What Is Programming?
A program is a list of instructions for the computer to
follow to process data. Programming, also known as software
development, typically follows a six-step process known as
the software development life cycle (SDLC). (See Figure 13-
1.)

reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 13-1 Software development
The six steps are as follows:
. Program specification: The program’s objectives, outputs,
inputs, and processing requirements are determined.
. Program design: A solution is created using programming
techniques such as top-down program design, pseudocode,
flowcharts, and logic structures.
. Program code: The program is written or coded using a
programming language.
. Program test: The program is tested or debugged by looking
for syntax and logic errors.
. Program documentation: Documentation is an ongoing process
throughout the programming process. This phase focuses on
formalizing the written description and processes used in
the program.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
. Program maintenance: Completed programs are periodically
reviewed to evaluate their accuracy, efficiency,
standardization, and ease of use. Changes are made to the
program’s code as needed.
In organizations, computer professionals known as software
engineers or programmers use this six-step procedure. In a
recent survey by Money magazine, software engineers were
ranked near the top of over 100 widely held jobs based on
salary, prestige, and security.
You may well find yourself working directly with a
programmer or indirectly through a systems analyst. Or you
may actually do the programming for a system that you
develop. Whatever the case, it’s important that you
understand the six-step programming procedure.
concept check
What is a program?
What are the six programming steps?

Step 1: Program Specification
Program specification is also called program definition or
program analysis. It requires that the programmer—or you,
the end user, if you are following this procedure—specify
five items: (1) the program’s objectives, (2) the desired
output, (3) the input data required, (4) the processing
requirements, and (5) the documentation. (See Figure 13-2.)
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 13-2 Step 1: Program specification
Program Objectives
You solve all kinds of problems every day. A problem might be
deciding how to commute to school or work or which homework
or report to do first. Thus, every day you determine your
objectives—the problems you are trying to solve. Programming
is the same. You need to make a clear statement of the
problem you are trying to solve. An example would be “I want
a time-and-billing system to record the time I spend on
different jobs for different clients of Advantage
Advertising.”
Desired Output
It is best always to specify outputs before inputs. That is,
you need to list what you want to get out of the computer
system. Then you should determine what will go into it. The
best way to do this is to draw a picture. You—the end user,
not the programmer—should sketch or write how you want the
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
output to look when it’s done. It might be printed out or
displayed on the monitor.
For example, if you want a time-and-billing report, you
might write or draw something like Figure 13-3. Another form
of output from the program might be bills to clients.
Figure 13-3 End user’s sketch of desired output
Description
Input Data
Once you know the output you want, you can determine the
input data and the source of this data. For example, for a
time-and-billing report, you can specify that one source of
data to be processed should be time cards. These are usually
logs or statements of hours worked submitted either 
electronically or on paper forms. The log shown in
Figure 13-4 is an example of the kind of input data used in
Advantage Advertising’s manual system. Note that military
time is used. For example, instead of writing “5:45 .,”
P.M
people would write “1745.”

expressed in military time
Description
Processing Requirements
Here you define the processing tasks that must happen for
input data to be processed into output. For Advantage, one of
the tasks for the program will be to add the hours worked for
different jobs for different clients.
Program Specifications Document
As in the systems life cycle, ongoing documentation is
essential. You should record program objectives, desired
outputs, needed inputs, and required processing. This leads
to the next step, program design.

outputs before inputs?

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Step 2: Program Design
After program specification, you begin program design. (See
Figure 13-5.) Here you plan a solution, preferably using
structured programming techniques. These techniques consist
of the following: (1) top-down program design, (2)
pseudocode, (3) flowcharts, and (4) logic structures.
Figure 13-5 Step 2: Program design
Top-Down Program Design
First determine the outputs and inputs for the program. Then
use top-down program design to identify the program’s
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
processing steps. Such steps are called program modules (or
just modules). Each module is made up of logically related
program statements.
An example of a top-down program design for a time-and-
billing report is shown in Figure 13-6. Each of the boxes
shown is a module. Under the rules of top-down design, each
module should have a single function. The program must pass
in sequence from one module to the next until all modules
have been processed by the computer. Three of the boxes
—“Obtain input,” “Compute hours for billing,” and
“Produce output”—correspond to the three principal
computer system operations: input, process, and output.
Figure 13-6 Example of top-down program design
Description
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Pseudocode
Pseudocode (pronounced “soo-doh-code”) is an outline of the
logic of the program you will write. It is like doing a
summary of the program before it is written. Figure 13-7
shows the pseudocode you might write for one module in the
time-and-billing program. This shows the reasoning behind
determining hours—including overtime hours—worked for
different jobs for one client, Client A. Again, note this
expresses the logic of what you want the program to do.
Figure 13-7 Example of pseudocode
Description
Flowcharts
We mentioned system flowcharts in the previous chapter. Here
we are concerned with program flowcharts. These graphically
present the detailed sequence of steps needed to solve a
programming problem. Figure 13-8 presents several of the
standard flowcharting symbols. An example of a program
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
flowchart is presented in Figure 13-9. This flowchart
expresses all the logic for just one module—“Compute time
on Client A jobs”—in the top-down program design.
Figure 13-8 Flowchart symbols
Perhaps you can see from this flowchart why a computer is
a computer, and not just an adding machine. One of the most
powerful capabilities of computers is their ability to make
logical comparisons. For example, a computer can compare two
items to determine if one is less than, greater than, or
equal to the other item.

Figure 13-9 Flowchart for “Compute time on Client A jobs”
Description

But have we skipped something? How do we know which kinds
of twists and turns to put in a flowchart so that it will
work logically? The answer is based on the use of logic
structures, as we will explain.
Logic Structures
How do you link the various parts of the flowchart? The best
way is a combination of three logic structures called
sequential, selection, and repetition. Using these
arrangements enables you to write structured programs, which
take much of the guesswork out of programming. Let us look at
the logic structures.
In the sequential structure, one program statement follows
another. Consider, for example, the “compute time”
flowchart. (Refer back to Figure 13-9.) Add regular hours
to total regular hours and Add overtime hours to total
overtime hours form a sequential structure. They logically
follow each other. There is no question of “yes” or
“no” or a decision suggesting other consequences. (See
Figure 13-10.)
The selection structure occurs when a decision must be
made. The outcome of the decision determines which of two
paths to follow. (See Figure 13-11.) This structure is also
known as an IF-THEN-ELSE structure because that is how you
can formulate the decision. Consider, for example, the
selection structure in the “compute time” flowchart,
which is concerned about computing overtime hours (Work

expressed in detail as follows:

past 1700 hours, ELSE overtime hours equal zero.
(See Figure 13-11.)
The repetition or loop structure describes a process that
may be repeated as long as a certain condition remains
true. The structure is called a “loop” or “iteration”
because the program loops around (iterates or repeats)
again and again. Consider the loop structure in the
“compute time” flowchart, which is concerned with testing
if there are more jobs (More jobs for clients?). It might
be expressed in detail as follows:
DO read in job information WHILE (that is, as long as)
there are more jobs.

The last thing to do before leaving the program design

Step 3: Program Code
Writing the program is called coding. Here you use the logic
you developed in the program design step to actually write
the program. (See Figure 13-13.) This is the “program code”
that instructs the computer what to do. Coding is what many
people think of when they think of programming. As we’ve
pointed out, however, it is only one of the six steps in the
programming process.

The Good Program
What are the qualities of a good program? Above all, it
should be reliable—that is, it should work under most
conditions and produce correct output. It should catch
obvious and common input errors. It also should be well
documented and understandable by programmers other than the
person who wrote it. After all, someone may need to make
changes in the program in the future. One of the best ways to
code effective programs is to write so-called structured
programs, using the logic structures described in Step 2:
Program Design.
Coding
After the program logic has been formulated, the next step is
to code, or write the program using the appropriate computer
language.

A programming language uses a collection of symbols,
words, and phrases that instruct a computer to perform
specific operations. Programming languages process data and
information for a wide variety of different types of
applications. Figure 13-14 presents the programming code
using C++, a widely used programming language, to calculate
the compute time module. For a description of C++ and some
other widely used programming languages, see Figure 13-15.

Step 4: Program Test
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Debugging refers to the process of testing and then
eliminating errors (“getting the bugs out”). (See Figure
13-16.) It means running the program on a computer and then
fixing the parts that do not work. Programming errors are of
two types: syntax errors and logic errors.
Figure 13-16 Step 4: Program test
Description
Syntax Errors
A syntax error is a violation of the rules of the programming
language. For example, in C++, each statement must end with a
semicolon (;). If the semicolon is omitted, then the program
will not run or execute due to a syntax error. For example,
Figure 13-17 shows testing of the compute time module in
which a syntax error was identified.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 13-17 Syntax error identified
Apple Inc.
Logic Errors
A logic error occurs when the programmer uses an incorrect
calculation or leaves out a programming procedure. For
example, a payroll program that did not compute overtime
hours would have a logic error.
Testing Process
Several methods have been devised for finding and removing
both types of errors, including desk checking, manually
testing, translating, running, and beta testing.
Desk checking: In desk checking or code review, a
programmer sitting at a desk checks (proofreads) a printout
of the program. The programmer goes through the listing
line by line carefully looking for syntax errors and logic
errors.
Manually testing with sample data: Using a 
calculator and sample data, a programmer follows
each program statement and performs every calculation.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Looking for programming logic errors, the programmer
compares the manually calculated values to those calculated
by the programs.
Attempt at translation: The program is run through a
computer, using a translator program. The translator
attempts to translate the written program from the
programming language (such as C++) into the machine
language. Before the program will run, it must be free of
syntax errors. Such errors will be identified by the
translating program. (See Figure 13-17.)
Testing sample data on the computer: After all syntax
errors have been corrected, the program is tested for logic
errors. Sample data is used to test the correct execution
of each program statement.
Testing by a select group of potential users: This is
sometimes called beta testing. It is usually the final step
in testing a program. Potential users try out the program
and provide feedback.
For a summary of Step 4: Program test, see Figure 13-18.

Briefly describe the testing process.

Step 5: Program Documentation
Documentation consists of written descriptions and procedures
about a program and how to use it. (See Figure 13-19.) It is
not something done just at the end of the programming
process. Program documentation is carried on throughout all
the programming steps. In this step, all the prior
documentation is reviewed, finalized, and distributed.
Documentation is important for people who may be involved
with the program in the future. These people may include the
following:
Users. Users need to know how to use the software. Some
organizations may offer training courses to guide users
through the program. However, other organizations may
expect users to be able to learn a package just from the
written documentation. Two examples of this sort of
documentation are printed manuals and the help option
within most applications.
Operators. Documentation must be provided for computer
operators. If the program sends them error messages, for
instance, they need to know what to do about them.
Programmers. As time passes, even the creator of the
original program may not remember much about it. Other
programmers wishing to update and modify it—that is,
perform program maintenance—may find themselves frustrated
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
without adequate documentation. This kind of documentation
should include text and program flowcharts, program
listings, and sample output. It also might include system
flowcharts to show how the particular program relates to
other programs within an information system.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Step 6: Program Maintenance
The final step is program maintenance. (See Figure 13-20.)
As much as 75 percent of the total lifetime cost for an
application program is for maintenance. This activity is so
commonplace that a special job title, maintenance
programmer, exists.
Figure 13-20 Step 6: Program maintenance
The purpose of program maintenance is to ensure that
current programs are operating error-free, efficiently, and
effectively. Activities in this area fall into two
categories: operations and changing needs.
Operations
Operations activities concern locating and correcting
operational errors, making programs easier to use, and
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
standardizing software using structured programming
techniques. For properly designed programs, these activities
should be minimal.
Programming modifications or corrections are often
referred to as patches. For software that is acquired, it is
common for the software manufacturer to periodically send
patches or updates for its software. If the patches are
significant, they are known as software updates.
Changing Needs
All organizations change over time, and their programs must
change with them. Programs need to be adjusted for a variety
of reasons, including new tax laws, new information needs,
and new company policies. Significant revisions may require
that the entire programming process begin again with program
specification.
Ideally, a software project sequentially follows the six
steps of software development. However, some projects start
before all requirements are known. In these cases, the SDLC
becomes a more cyclical process, repeated several times
throughout the development of the software. For example,
agile development, a popular development 
methodology, starts by getting core functionality
of a program working, and then expands on it until the
customer is satisfied with the results. All six steps are
repeated over and over as quickly as possible to create
incrementally more functional versions of the application.
Figure 13-21 summarizes the six steps of the programming
process.

desired output, required input,

time.

CASE and OOP
You hear about efficiency and productivity everywhere. They
are particularly important for software development. Two
resources that promise to help are CASE tools and object-
oriented software development.
CASE Tools
Professional programmers are constantly looking for ways to
make their work easier, faster, and more reliable. One tool
we mentioned in Chapter 12, CASE, is meeting this need.
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools provide
reset

some automation and assistance in program design, coding, and
testing. (See Figure 13-22.)

Figure 13-22 Sparx Systems offers the CASE tool Enterprise
Architect
Smartdraw Software, LLC.
Object-Oriented Software Development
Traditional systems development is a careful, step-by-step
approach focusing on the procedures needed to complete a
certain objective. Object-oriented software development
focuses less on the procedures and more on defining the
relationships between previously defined procedures or
“objects.” Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a process
by which a program is organized into objects. Each object
contains both the data and processing operations necessary to
perform a task. Let’s explain what this means.
In the past, programs were developed as giant entities,
from the first line of code to the last. This has been
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
compared to building a car from scratch. Object-oriented
programming is like building a car from prefabricated parts—
carburetor, alternator, fenders, and so on. Object-oriented
programs use objects that are reusable, self-contained
components. Programs built with these objects assume that
certain functions are the same. For example, many programs,
from spreadsheets to database managers, have an instruction
that will sort lists of names in alphabetical order. A
programmer might use this object for alphabetizing in many
other programs. There is no need to invent this activity anew
every time. C++ is one of the most widely used object-
oriented programming languages.

Generations of Programming
Languages
Computer professionals talk about levels or generations of
programming languages, ranging from “low” to “high.”
Programming languages are called lower level when they are
closer to the language the computer itself uses. The computer
understands the 0s and 1s that make up bits and bytes.
Programming languages are called higher level when they are
closer to the language humans use—that is, for English
speakers, more like English.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
There are five generations of programming languages: (1)
machine languages, (2) assembly languages, (3) procedural
languages, (4) task-oriented languages, and (5) problem and
constraint languages.
Machine Languages: The First Generation
We mentioned in Chapter 5 that a byte is made up of bits,
consisting of 1s and 0s. These 1s and 0s may correspond to
electricity being on or off in the computer. They also may
correspond to a magnetic charge being present or absent on
storage media such as disc or tape. From this two-state
system, coding schemes have been developed that allow us to
construct letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and other
special characters. Examples of these coding schemes, as we
saw, are ASCII, EBCDIC, and Unicode.
Data represented in 1s and 0s is said to be written in
machine language. To see how hard this is to understand,
imagine if you had to code this:
Machine languages also vary according to make of computer—
another characteristic that makes them hard to work with.
Assembly Languages: The Second Generation
Before a computer can process or run any program, the program
must be converted or translated into machine language.
Assembly languages use abbreviations or mnemonics such as ADD
that are automatically converted to the appropriate sequence
of 1s and 0s. Compared to machine languages, assembly
languages are much easier for humans to understand and to
use. The machine language code we gave above could be
expressed in assembly language as
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
This is still pretty obscure, of course, and so assembly
language is also considered low level.
Assembly languages also vary from computer to computer.
With the third generation, we advance to high-level
languages, many of which are considered portable languages.
That is, they can be run on more than one kind of computer—
they are “portable” from one machine to another.
High-Level Procedural Languages: The Third Generation
People are able to understand languages that are more like
their own (e.g., English) than machine languages or assembly
languages. These more English-like programming languages are
called “high-level” languages. However, most people still
require some training to use higher-level languages. This is
particularly true of procedural languages.
Procedural languages, also known as 3GLs (third-
generation languages), are designed to express the logic—
the procedures—that can solve general problems. 
Procedural languages, then, are intended to solve
general problems and are the most widely used languages to
create software applications. C++ is a procedural language
widely used by today’s programmers. For example, C++ was
used in Advantage Advertising’s time-and-billing report.
(See Figure 13-14 again for the compute time module of this
program.)
Consider the following C++ statement from a program that
assigns letter grades based on the score of an exam:
This statement tests whether the score is greater than or
equal to 90. If it is, then the letter grade of A is
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
assigned.
Like assembly languages, procedural languages must be
translated into machine language so that the computer
processes them. Depending on the language, this translation
is performed by either a compiler or an interpreter.
A compiler converts the programmer’s procedural language
program, called the source code, into a machine language
code, called the object code. This object code can then be
saved and run later. The standard version of C++ is a
procedural language that uses a compiler.
An interpreter converts the procedural language one
statement at a time into machine code just before it is to
be executed. No object code is saved. An example of a
procedural language using an interpreter is the standard
version of BASIC.
What is the difference between using a compiler and using
an interpreter? When a program is run, the compiler requires
two steps. The first step is to convert the entire program’s
source code to object code. The second step is to run the
object code. The interpreter, in contrast, converts and runs
the program one line at a time. The advantage of a compiler
language is that once the object code has been obtained, the
program executes faster. The advantage of an interpreter
language is that programs are easier to develop.
Task-Oriented Languages: The Fourth Generation
Third-generation languages are valuable, but they require
training in programming. Task-oriented languages, also known
as 4GLs (fourth-generation languages) and very high level
languages, require little special training on the part of the
user.
Unlike general-purpose languages, task-oriented languages
are designed to solve specific problems. While 3GLs focus on
procedures and how logic can be combined to solve a variety
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
of problems, 4GLs are nonprocedural and focus on specifying
the specific tasks the program is to accomplish. 4GLs are
more English-like, easier to program, and widely used by
nonprogrammers. Some of these fourth-generation languages are
used for very specific applications. For example, IFPS
(interactive financial planning system) is used to develop
financial models. Many 4GLs are part of a database management
system. 4GLs include query languages and application
generators:
Query languages: Query languages enable nonprogrammers to
use certain easily understood commands to search and
generate reports from a database. One of the most widely
used query languages is SQL (Structured Query Language).
For example, let’s assume that Advantage Advertising has a
database containing all customer calls for service and that
its management would like a listing of all clients who
incurred overtime charges. The SQL command to create this
list is
This SQL statement selects or identifies all clients (a
field name from the dailyLog table) that required service
after 17 (military time for 5:00 ). Microsoft Access can
P.M.
generate SQL commands like this one by using its Query
wizard.
Application generators: An application generator 
or a program coder is a program that provides
modules of prewritten code. When using an application
generator, a programmer can quickly create a program by
referencing the module(s) that performs certain tasks. This
greatly reduces the time to create an application. For
example, Access has a report generation application and a
Report wizard for creating a variety of different types of
reports using database information.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Problem and Constraint Languages: The Fifth Generation
As they have evolved through the generations, computer
languages have become more humanlike. Clearly, the fourth-
generation query languages using commands that include words
like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are much more humanlike than the
0s and 1s of machine language. However, 4GLs are still a long
way from the natural languages such as English and Spanish
that people use.
The next step in programming languages will be the fifth-
generation language (5GL), or computer languages that
incorporate the concepts of artificial intelligence to allow
a person to provide a system with a problem and some
constraints and then request a solution. Additionally, these
languages would enable a computer to learn and to apply new
information as people do. Rather than coding by keying in
specific commands, we would communicate more directly to a
computer using natural languages.
Consider the following natural language statement that
might appear in a 5GL program for recommending medical
treatment:
When will fifth-generation languages become a reality?
That’s difficult to say; however, researchers are actively
working on the development of 5GL languages and have
demonstrated some success.
See Figure 13-23 for a summary of the generations of
programming languages.

programmers also may be employed in various other

basis as consultants, meaning they are hired by a company
only to complete a specific program. As technology has

basic computer functions has decreased. However, demand for
computer programmers with specializations in advanced
programs continues.

Jobs in programming typically require a bachelor’s
degree in computer science or information systems. However,
positions are available in the field for those with a two-
year degree. Employers looking for programmers typically
put an emphasis on previous experience. Programmers who
have patience, think logically, and pay attention to detail
are continually in demand. Additionally, programmers who

people are preferred.
Computer programmers can expect to earn an annual salary

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Your Own Programmable Robot
Have you ever dreamed of having your own robot that could help you with
all your chores? Wouldn’t it be nice if that robot understood every word
you said and required no complex programming from you? Such a robot will
be possible in the future as the field of robotics keeps advancing.
Currently, robots are used in many manufacturing roles, making everything
from cars to frozen pancakes. Recently, there are already several
companies that are mass-producing programmable robots for individuals and
educational institutions. It is just a matter of time before these robots
can understand human instructions instead of complex programming
languages. Technology has been making better programming tools and will
continue to evolve to improve our lives as we look to the future.
One of the earliest robots that was made available to consumers was the
Roomba from iRobot, which is essentially an automated, intelligent vacuum
cleaner. Since then, the same company has released robots that wash
floors, clean pools, and clear gutters. The programming is handled by the
robot’s developers, with the end user doing very little except turning
the robot on. As well as these robots perform, their function is limited
to their programmed task.
A company named Aldebaran Robotics has taken a different approach,
creating small, humanoid robots, called Nao, which the end user can
program. Although the Nao robots are being mass-produced, they are a bit
too expensive for the average home. Currently, they are being marketed
toward schools and research institutions. Using a GUI, students can create
programs that the robot will follow. Alternatively, programmers can use
one of several supported languages to write their own custom scripts for
Nao.

In the future, it will not be necessary for someone to use software or
know a programming language to communicate with a robot. Developers will
use sophisticated programming to give the robot the artificial
intelligence necessary to understand natural language. This software will
be embedded in a chip within the robot. When you purchase a robot, all you
will have to do is speak the commands in normal, conversational English.
If you want the robot to help you clean the pool or lift a heavy box, you
can tell the robot in the same manner you would tell another person.
The hardware components needed to make robots are becoming cheaper.
However, the software remains a challenge. Human languages and
conversations remain very difficult for a computer to fully understand.
Speech recognition continues to improve, and we are seeing this technology
embedded in the latest cell phones. Nevertheless, many improvements are
necessary before a humanoid robot will be able to converse with us.
Do you think you will be able to own a humanoid robot in your lifetime?
Do you believe that programmers will be able to make these robots
intelligent enough to carry on conversations and perform a wide variety of
tasks?

PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMMING
A program is a list of instructions for a computer to
follow. Programming (software development) is a six-
step procedure for creating programs.
The steps are
Program specification—defining objectives, inputs,
outputs, and processing requirements.
Program design—creating a solution using structured
programming tools and techniques such as top-down
program design, pseudocode, program flowcharts, and
logic structures.
Program code—writing or coding the program using a
programming language.
Program test—testing or debugging the program by
looking for syntax and logic errors.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Program documentation—ongoing process throughout the
programming process.
Program maintenance—periodically evaluating programs
for accuracy, efficiency, standardization, and ease of
use and modifying program code as needed.
STEP 1: PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
Program specification, also called program definition
or program analysis, consists of specifying five tasks
related to objectives, outputs, inputs, requirements, and
documentation.
Program Objectives
The first task is to clearly define the problem to solve
in the form of program objectives.
Desired Output
Next, focus on the desired output before considering the
required inputs.
Input Data
Once outputs are defined, determine the necessary input
data and the source of the data.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Processing Requirements
Next, determine the steps necessary (processing
requirements) to use input to produce output.
Program Specifications Document
The final task is to create a specifications document to
record this step’s program objectives, outputs, inputs,
and processing requirements.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand the six steps of programming: program
specification, program design, program coding, program
test, program documentation, and program maintenance.
Additionally, you need to be aware of CASE, OOP, and
the generations of programming languages.
STEP 2: PROGRAM DESIGN
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In program design, a solution is designed using,
preferably, structured programming techniques,
including the following.
Top-Down Program Design
In top-down program design, major processing steps,
called program modules (or modules), are identified.
Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an outline of the logic of the program you
will write.
Flowcharts
Program flowcharts are graphic representations of the
steps necessary to solve a programming problem.
Logic Structures
Logic structures are arrangements of programming
statements. Three types are
Sequential—one program statement followed by another.
Selection (IF-THEN-ELSE)—when a decision must be
made.
Repetition (loop)—when a process is repeated until
the condition is true.
STEP 3: PROGRAM CODE
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Coding is writing a program. There are several important
aspects of writing a program. Two are writing good
programs and actually writing or coding.
Good Programs
Good programs are reliable, detect obvious and common
errors, and are well documented. The best way to create
good programs is to write structured programs using the
three basic logic structures presented in Step 2.
Coding
There are hundreds of different programming languages.
Programming languages instruct a computer to perform
specific operations. C++ is a widely used programming
language.

STEP 4: PROGRAM TEST
Debugging is a process of testing and eliminating errors
in a program. Syntax and logic are two types of
programming errors.
Syntax Errors
Syntax errors are violations of the rules of a
programming language. For example, omitting a semicolon
at the end of a C++ statement is a syntax error.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Logic Errors
Logic errors are incorrect calculations or procedures.
For example, failure to include calculation of overtime
hours in a payroll program is a logic error.
Testing Process
Five methods for testing for syntax and logic errors are
Desk checking (code review)—careful reading of a
printout of the program.
Manual testing—using a calculator and sample data to
test for correct programming logic.
Attempt at translation—running the program using a
translator program to identify syntax errors.
Testing sample data—running the program and testing
the program for logic errors using sample data.
Testing by users (beta testing)—final step in which
potential users try the program and provide feedback.

STEP 5: PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Program documentation consists of a written description
of the program and the procedures for running it. People
who use documentation include
Users, who need to know how to use the program. Some
organizations offer training courses; others expect
users to learn from written documentation.
Operators, who need to know how to execute the program
and how to recognize and correct errors.
Programmers, who may need to update and maintain the
program in the future. Documentation could include text
and program flowcharts, program listings, and sample
outputs.

Organizations change over time, and their programs must
change with them. Agile development starts with core
program functionality and expands until the customer is
satisfied with the results.

CASE AND OOP
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Smartdraw Software, LLC.
CASE
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools
provide automation and assistance in program design,
coding, and testing.
OOP
Traditional systems development focuses on procedures to
complete a specific objective.
Object-oriented software development focuses less on
procedures and more on defining relationships between
previously defined procedures or objects. Object-
oriented programming (OOP) is a process by which a
program is divided into modules called objects. Each
object contains both the data and processing operations
necessary to perform a task.
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE GENERATIONS
Programming languages have levels or generations ranging
from low to high. Lower-level languages are closer to
the 0s and 1s language of computers. Higher-level
languages are closer to the languages of humans.

The Evolution of the Computer
Age
Many of you probably can’t remember a world without
computers, but for some of us, computers were virtually
unknown when we were born and have rapidly come of age during
our lifetime.
Although there are many predecessors to what we think of
as the modern computer—reaching as far back as the 18th
century, when Joseph Marie Jacquard created a loom programmed
to weave cloth and Charles Babbage created the first fully
modern computer design (which he could never get to work)—
the computer age did not really begin until the first
computer was made available to the public in 1951.
The modern age of computers thus spans slightly more than
65 years (so far), which is typically broken down into five
generations. Each generation has been marked by a significant
advance in technology.
• First Generation (1951–57): During the first generation,
computers were built with vacuum tubes—electronic tubes that
were made of glass and were about the size of lightbulbs.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

• Second Generation (1958–63): This generation began with
the first computers built with transistors—small devices
that transfer electronic signals across a resistor. Because
transistors are much smaller, use less power, and create less
heat than vacuum tubes, the new computers were faster,
smaller, and more reliable than the first-generation
machines.

• Third Generation (1964–69): In 1964, computer
manufacturers began replacing transistors with integrated
circuits. An integrated circuit (IC) is a complete electronic
circuit on a small chip made of silicon (one of the most
abundant elements in the earth’s crust). These computers
were more reliable and compact than computers made with
transistors, and they cost less to manufacture.
• Fourth Generation (1970–90): Many key advances were made
during this generation, the most significant being the
microprocessor—a specialized chip developed for computer
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
memory and logic. Use of a single chip to create a smaller
“personal” computer (as well as digital watches, pocket
calculators, copy machines, and so on) revolutionized the
computer industry.
Victor R. Boswell Jr./National Geographic/Getty Images
• Fifth Generation (1991–2021 and beyond): Our current
generation has been referred to as the “Connected
Generation” because of the industry’s massive effort to
increase the connectivity of computers. The rapidly expanding
Internet, World Wide Web, and intranets have created an
information superhighway that has enabled both computer
professionals and home computer users to communicate with
others across the globe.
This appendix provides you with a timeline that describes
in more detail some of the most significant events in each
generation of the computer age.

The Computer Buyer’s Guide
PART 1: WHICH TYPES OF COMPUTERS SHOULD
YOU PURCHASE?
Many individuals feel confused and overwhelmed when it comes
to buying a new computer. In today’s market, there are
various categories of computers ranging from desktops and
laptops to ultraportable tablets and smartphones. And within
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
each category, there are countless choices and a wide range
of prices. This buying guide will help you choose the best
combination of computers for your needs, as well as point out
some key specifications that they should have.
LAPTOP COMPUTERS: TODAY’S STANDARD
Typical Recommendation: Buy a $700 to $1,000 laptop
with a 13-inch screen.
The laptop computer has become the must-have device that can
do everything you need, wherever you need it. They are
powerful enough to be your primary home computer (replacing
desktops) while portable enough to take to school, work, the
local coffee shop, and even on your next trip. Many students
are bringing them to classes to take notes and perform
research. If you can own only one computer, make it a laptop.
Affordable ones start at under $700.
If you have decided that you want to buy a laptop
computer, be sure to read Part 2 for additional tips and
recommendations.
SMARTPHONES: COMPUTERS IN YOUR POCKET
Typical Recommendation: Obtain a free or low-cost
smartphone by signing a two-year wireless contract
with a data plan.
For many individuals, the smartphone has become much like a
wallet, purse, or keys—you don’t leave home without it.
This single pocket-sized device fills many roles. It is a
mobile phone, digital camera, video recorder, gaming device,
and personal digital assistant. Most individuals purchase a
smartphone because they need to access information quickly
and easily, regardless of where they are.
With many smartphones now available for free with two-year
contracts, it is easier than ever to replace your older cell
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
phone. The biggest drawback to owning a smartphone is that
its “use anywhere” benefit is limited if it is not paired
with a wireless data plan, which can often cost around $30
per month.
Although Apple’s iPhone was once the clear leader in the
smartphone market, various Android devices include
competitive features and are enjoying favorable reviews. If
you have decided that you want to buy a smartphone, be sure
to read Part 2 for additional tips and recommendations.
TABLETS: THE RISING STARS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a 10-inch tablet with 64
GB of storage.
The release of the iPad has revived this category of
computers. With an attractive, 10-inch touch-screen surface,
it has quickly become a popular device for watching videos,
playing games, reading e-books, and browsing the web. Tablets
are light enough to hold comfortably for many hours, yet
powerful enough to use a variety of apps. They generally have
a much longer battery life than laptop computers.
If you are a typical computer user, then you may not
benefit much from purchasing a tablet computer. Most of your
computing time will be spent on your laptop computer (at home
and at school, for example) or on your smartphone. Although
tablets are very popular right now, you must remember that
they cost several hundred dollars. You should have a very
clear need for this sort of device before you decide to spend
the money on it.
Many students consider buying tablets because the low
weight makes a tablet easy to carry around. Although this is
true, there are lightweight laptop computers that weigh only
one or two pounds more and are much more versatile than
tablets. Such versatility is crucial for various types of
software that are not available as apps and require
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
installation on a Windows or Mac computer. Before you decide
between a tablet and lightweight laptop, consider the type of
software you will need for your schoolwork, business, or
personal use. If everything you need is available 
as a mobile app, then a tablet (paired with a
wireless keyboard) will be more affordable than a lightweight
laptop computer.
In conclusion, purchase a tablet computer only if you see
yourself using it often. The touch-screen interface, low
weight, and long battery life do indeed make it easy to carry
around and use almost anywhere you go. However, the price tag
does not make the decision an obvious one if you already own
a laptop computer and smartphone. If you have decided that
you want to buy a tablet, be sure to read Part 2 for
additional tips and recommendations.
DESKTOPS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a tower system with a
20- to 24-inch monitor for approximately $900.
Desktop (or tower) computers have been around for a long
time. You will still find them in many offices and homes.
However, they are steadily losing popularity because laptop
computers have become very powerful and affordable. Why have
a computer that remains stuck in your home or office when you
can have a laptop that can be taken almost anywhere?
Although laptop computers seem to be the better choice,
there are several reasons why you might want to purchase a
desktop computer. First, the use of a laptop computer as your
primary computer can be uncomfortable. After prolonged use,
it can place stress on your neck, back, and wrists. Desktops
typically come with large monitors, and various types of
ergonomic keyboards are available. However, desktop critics
will point out that laptop computers can be connected to
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
external monitors and keyboards as well. The only downside is
that a laptop requires the purchase of extra equipment.
The other reason to get a desktop is if you have a
specific need that cannot be addressed by a laptop computer.
For example, some families have a media center computer that
holds all the videos, photos, and music for the entire home
network. Another example involves gamers, who often seek to
build or customize extremely powerful computers. They often
choose desktops for this endeavor.
Most users will not need to purchase a desktop computer.
In fact, they are currently the least popular of the four
categories in this buying guide. However, if you have decided
that you want to buy a desktop, be sure to read Part 2 for
additional tips and recommendations.
PART 2: PERSONALIZED BUYING GUIDE
Now that you have decided which types of computers you need,
it is time to explore computer specifications. The following
areas explore the decision-making process from the
perspective of various buyers.
LAPTOPS
There are two basic categories of laptops: the traditional
laptop and the ultrabook. Although these two categories of
laptop computers have the same general appearance, they vary
greatly in power, storage capacity, weight, and battery life.
The following section helps you find the device that best
meets your needs.
User #1: I am a power user. I need a portable computer that
can handle the latest video games or process-intensive
operations such as video editing, engineering, and design.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Response #1: Purchase a traditional laptop computer that
includes the following minimum specs:
The fastest categories of processors with large number of
cores and high GHz count
A graphics processor (GPU) outside of the main CPU
16-GB RAM
1-TB hard drive
17-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $1,500, perhaps more. For games,
many individuals choose Windows-based PCs. The video and
design industries usually use Macs.
User #2: I am a regular user. I need a desktop replacement
and portable computer. I typically run office software, use
the Internet, and listen to music.
Response #2: Purchase an affordable traditional laptop
computer that includes the following specs:
Middle-tier processors—not the fastest but not the
slowest either
8-GB RAM
500-GB hard drive
15-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $800 to $1,000. For maximum
savings, as well as compatibility with most software, many
buyers choose Windows-based PCs. Be sure to purchase an
external monitor, keyboard, and mouse if you plan on heavy
use while at home.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
User #3: I want a small, lightweight computer that I can
carry anywhere. I would like long battery life for extended
use.
Response #3: Purchase an ultrabook with
11- to 13-inch screen
Solid-state hard drive
8-GB RAM
Weight under 4 pounds
Expect to pay $700 to $1,000. Many ultrabooks will not
include a DVD drive. Windows-based ultrabooks tend to be more
affordable. The MacBook Air is slightly more 
expensive, but it has always been considered a
leader in the lightweight laptop field.
SMARTPHONES
Shopping for a smartphone involves three separate processes:
(1) choosing an operating system, either iOS or Android; (2)
choosing a device; and (3) choosing a wireless carrier.
Although the following section does not review different
wireless companies or data plans, it presents a list of
smartphone features that you should always consider before
making your choice. In addition, it presents each smartphone
operating system from the perspective of typical users.
Features to Consider
Screen and device size: Consider a size (and weight) that
is comfortable for you to use and carry around. Four-inch
screens are now typical.
Screen resolution: Some devices deliver HD quality for
sharp photos and videos.
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Integrated keyboard: Consider one if you type often on
these devices.
Storage: Having 64 GB is enough for most users. Choose
128 GB or more if you plan to store large quantities of
music, photos, and videos. Some devices allow you to
increase storage by using memory cards.
Battery life: About 7 to 8 hours is typical. Some devices
have removable batteries.
Cameras: Many include front- and rear-facing cameras.
Compare megapixels and photo quality.
App market: Consider the number of apps, and ensure that
any apps you need are available for this operating
system.
Operating Systems
iOS: The iPhone is considered by many to be the standard
against which all smartphones are measured. Buyers
typically choose the iPhone if they are Mac owners or
prefer a tightly controlled “ecosystem” from Apple
where stability and ease of use are favored over heavy
customization.
Android: There are many Android devices available from
various manufacturers, some free with a wireless
contract. Buyers who enjoy customizing their interface
typically choose Android. In addition, this operating
system is tightly integrated with many of Google’s
products and services.
Remember that smartphones can cost very little when you sign
a two-year contract with a wireless company. Consider whether
you want to make that sort of commitment.
TABLET COMPUTERS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Because of their increased popularity, tablets are available
in several sizes from many different companies. The following
section helps you find the device that best meets your needs.
User #1: I want to watch videos, play games, create notes,
and browse websites.
Response #1: Purchase a 10-inch tablet. Expect to pay $400
to $500. Most weigh about 1.5 pounds. Apple’s iPad was very
popular when first released, and it continues to be a popular
choice among buyers today. Other things to consider:
For greater customization, consider an Android-based
tablet. Several models are comparable to the iPad, which
is considered by many reviewers to be the standard
bearer.
The Microsoft Surface tablet includes a keyboard that is
integrated into the cover. However, any tablet can be
paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, which is crucial if you
plan to type often.
Make sure the apps you plan on using are available for
the tablet’s operating system.
Having 16 GB of storage is typical. Some tablets let you
expand this by using flash memory cards.
User #2: I want to read e-books, browse websites, and have a
lightweight device that I can hold with one hand.
Response #2: Purchase a 7-inch tablet. Expect to pay around
$200. Most weigh less than 1 pound. Google’s Nexus 7 and
Amazon’s Kindle Fire are popular Android-based tablets.
DESKTOP COMPUTERS
reset 
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
