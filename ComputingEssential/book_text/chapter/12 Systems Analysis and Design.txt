Why should I read this chapter?
When an organization designs and implements a new system, jobs are on the
line. A well-designed system can make a career; a poor one can destroy a
company. Systems analysis and design details the framework for creating
new systems. In the future, information systems will rely on cloud-based
services, giving easier upgrades, improved security, and higher
reliability.

“Hi,
I’m Marie, and I’m a systems analyst. I’d like to talk

Most people in an organization are involved with an information system of
some kind. For an organization to create and effectively use a system
requires considerable thought and effort. Fortunately, there is a six-step
process for accomplishing this. It is known as systems analysis and
design.
Big organizations can make big mistakes. For example, a large
automobile manufacturer once spent $40 billion putting in factory robots
and other high technology in its automaking plants. Unfortunately, the
manufacturer could never make these new changes work and removed much of
the equipment and reinstalled its original production systems. Why did the
high-tech production systems fail? The probable reason was that not enough
energy was devoted to training its workforce in using the new systems.
The government also can make big mistakes. In one year, the Internal
Revenue Service computer system was so overwhelmed it could not deliver
tax refunds on time. How did this happen? Despite extensive testing of
much of the system, not all testing was completed. Thus, when the new
system was phased in, the IRS found it could not process tax returns as
quickly as it had hoped.
Both of these examples show the necessity for thorough planning—
especially when an organization is trying to implement a new kind of
system. Systems analysis and design reduces the chances for such
spectacular failures.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the importance of systems analysis and design. You need to be aware of the
relationship of an organization’s chart to its managerial structure.
Additionally, you need to know the six phases of the systems development
life cycle: preliminary investigation, systems analysis, systems design,
systems development, systems implementation, and systems maintenance.

Systems Analysis and Design
A system is a collection of activities and elements organized
to accomplish a goal. As we saw in Chapter 10, an information
system is a collection of hardware, software, people,
procedures, data, and the Internet. These work together to
provide information essential to running an organization.
This information helps produce a product or service and, for
profit-oriented businesses, derive a profit.
Information about orders received, products shipped, money
owed, and so on flows into an organization from the outside.
Information about what supplies have been received, which
customers have paid their bills, and so on also flows within
the organization. To avoid confusion, the flow of information
must follow a route that is defined by a set of rules and
procedures. However, from time to time, organizations need to
change their information systems. Reasons include
organizational growth, mergers and acquisitions, new
marketing opportunities, revisions in governmental
regulations, and availability of new technology.
page 295
Systems analysis and design is a six-phase problem-
solving procedure for examining and improving an information
system. The six phases make up the systems life cycle. (See
Figure 12-1.) The phases are as follows:
. Preliminary investigation: The organization’s problems or
needs are identified and summarized in a short report.
. Systems analysis: The present system is studied in depth.
New requirements are specified and documented.
. Systems design: A new or alternative information system is
designed and a design report created.
reset page 701
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
. Systems development: New hardware and software are
acquired, developed, and tested.
. Systems implementation: The new information system is
installed, and people are trained to use it.
. Systems maintenance: In this ongoing phase, the system is
periodically evaluated and updated as needed.
Figure 12-1 The six-phase systems life cycle
In organizations, this six-phase systems life cycle is
used by computer professionals known as systems analysts.
These people study an organization’s systems to determine
what actions to take and how to use computer technology to
assist them.
As an end user, working alone or with a systems analyst,
it is important that you understand how the systems life
cycle works. In fact, you may have to use the procedure.
Every career is affected by information systems, and
reset page 702
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
understanding how they are created and used will allow you to
work smarter and avoid common mistakes.
There are many misconceptions about the life cycle of an
information system. Those unfamiliar with the life cycle
model are likely to consider the design, development, and
implementation phases as the most important. However, many
information systems fail because of a lack of investigation
and analysis. Further, many information systems go over
budget or become obsolete too quickly because of a failure to
recognize the importance of system maintenance. It can be a
thankless task, insisting that design and development be
delayed to ensure that investigation and analysis be done
throughly. Further, inexperienced developers, in an effort to
save money, will look to reduce or underestimate maintenance
expenses. However, the long-term success of an information
system is dependent on understanding the value and necessity
of each of the phases.
Learning the six steps described in this chapter will
raise your computer efficiency and effectiveness. It also
will give you skills to solve a wide range of problems. These
skills can make you more valuable to an organization.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Phase 1: Preliminary
Investigation
The first phase of the systems life cycle is a preliminary
investigation of a proposed project to determine the need for
a new information system. This usually is requested by an end
user or a manager who wants something done that is not
presently being done. For example, suppose you work for
Advantage Advertising, a fast-growing advertising agency.
Advantage Advertising produces a variety of different ads for
a wide range of different clients. The agency employs both
regular staff workers and on-call freelancers. One of your
responsibilities is keeping track of the work performed for
each client and the employees who performed the work. In
addition, you are responsible for tabulating the final bill
for each project.
How do you figure out how to charge which clients for
which work done by which employees? This kind of problem is
common to many service organizations (such as lawyers’ and
contractors’ offices). Indeed, it is a problem in any
organization where people charge for their time and clients
need proof of hours worked.
In Phase 1, the systems analyst—or the end user—is
concerned with three tasks: (1) briefly defining the problem,
(2) suggesting alternative solutions, and (3) preparing a
short report. (See Figure 12-2.) This report will help
management decide whether to pursue the project further. (If
you are an end user, you may not produce a written report.
Rather, you might report your findings directly to your
supervisor.)
reset page 704
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 12-2 Phase 1: Preliminary investigation
Defining the Problem
Defining the problem means examining whatever current
information system is in use. Determining what information is
needed, by whom, when, and why is accomplished by
interviewing and making observations. If the information
system is large, this survey is done by a systems analyst. If
the system is small, the survey can be done by the end user.
For example, suppose Advantage Advertising account
executives, copywriters, and graphic artists currently record
the time spent on different jobs on their desk calendars.
(Examples might be “Client A, telephone conference, 15
minutes”; “Client B, design layout, 2 hours.”) After
interviewing several account executives and page 297
listening to their frustrations, it becomes clear
that the approach is somewhat disorganized. (See Figure 12-
3.) Written calendar entries are too unprofessional to be
reset page 705
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
shown to clients. Moreover, a large job often has many people
working on it. It is difficult to pull together all their
notations to make up a bill for the client. Some freelancers
work at home, and their time slips are not readily available.
These matters constitute a statement of the problem: The
company has a manual time-and-billing system that is slow and
difficult to use.
Figure 12-3 One step in defining problems with the current
system is to interview executives
ESB Professional/Shutterstock
As an end user, you might experience difficulties with
this system yourself. You’re in someone else’s office, and
a telephone call comes in for you from a client. Your desk
calendar is back in your own office. You have two choices.
You can always carry your calendar with you, or you can
remember to note the time you spent on various tasks when you
return to your office. The administrative assistant reporting
to the account executive is continually after you (and
everyone else at Advantage) to provide photocopies of your
calendar. This is so that various clients can be billed for
the work done on various jobs. Surely, you think, there must
be a better way to handle time and billing.
reset page 706
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Suggesting Alternative Systems
This step is simply to suggest some possible plans as
alternatives to the present arrangement. For instance,
Advantage could hire more administrative assistants to
collect the information from everyone’s calendars (including
telephoning those working at home). Or it could use the
existing system of network-linked personal computers that
staffers and freelancers presently use. Perhaps, you think,
there is already some off-the-shelf packaged software
available that could be used for a time-and-billing system.
At least there might be one that would make your own job
easier.
Preparing a Short Report
For large projects, the systems analyst writes a report
summarizing the results of the preliminary investigation and
suggesting alternative systems. The report also may include
schedules for further development of the project. This
document is presented to higher management, along with a
recommendation to continue or discontinue the project.
Management then decides whether to finance the second phase,
the systems analysis.
For Advantage Advertising, your report might point out
that billing is frequently delayed. It could say that some
tasks may even “slip through the cracks” and not get
charged at all. Thus, as the analyst has noted, you suggest
the project might pay for itself merely by eliminating lost
or forgotten charges.

Phase 2: Systems Analysis
In Phase 2, systems analysis, data is collected about the
present system. This data is then analyzed, and new
requirements are determined. We are not concerned with a new
design here, only with determining the requirements for a new
system. Systems analysis is concerned with gathering and
analyzing the data. This usually is completed by documenting
the analysis in a report. (See Figure 12-4.)
Figure 12-4 Phase 2: Systems analysis
reset page 708
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Gathering Data
When gathering data, the systems analyst—or the end user
doing systems analysis—expands on the data gathered during
Phase 1. He or she adds details about how the current system
works. Data is obtained from observation and interviews. In
addition, data may be obtained from questionnaires given to
people using the system. Data also is obtained from studying
documents that describe the formal lines of authority and
standard operating procedures. One such document is the
organization chart, which shows levels of management as well
as formal lines of authority.
Analyzing the Data
In the data analysis step, the idea is to learn how
information currently flows and to pinpoint why it isn’t
flowing appropriately. The whole point of this step is to
apply logic to the existing arrangement to see how workable
it is. Many times, the current system is not operating
correctly because prescribed procedures are not being
followed. That is, the system may not really need to be
redesigned. Rather, the people in it may need to be shown how
to follow correct procedures.
Many different tools are available to assist systems
analysts and end users in the analysis phase. Some of the
most important are the top-down analysis method, grid charts,
system flowcharts, data flow diagrams, and automated design
tools.
Top-down analysis method: The top-down analysis method is
used to identify the top-level components of a complex
system. Each component is then broken down into smaller and
smaller components. This approach makes each component
easier to analyze and deal with.
page 299
reset page 709
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
For instance, the systems analyst might look at the
present kind of bill submitted to a client for a complex
advertising campaign. The analyst might note the categories
of costs—employee salaries, telephone and mailing charges,
travel, supplies, and so on.
Grid charts: A grid chart shows the relationship between
input and output documents. An example is shown in Figure
12-5 that indicates the relationship between the data input
and the outputs.
For instance, a time sheet is one of many inputs that
produces a particular report, such as a client’s bill.
Other inputs might be forms having to do with telephone
conferences and travel expenses. On a grid sheet, rows
represent inputs, such as time sheet forms. Columns
represent output documents, such as different clients’
bills. A check mark at the intersection of a row and column
means that the input document is used to create the output
document.
System flowcharts: System flowcharts show the flow of
input data to processing and finally to output, or
distribution of information. An example of a system
flowchart keeping track of time for advertising “creative
people” is shown in Figure 12-6. The explanation of the
symbols used appears in Figure 12-7. Note that this
describes the present manual, or noncomputerized, system.
(A system flowchart is not the same as a program flowchart,
which is very detailed. Program flowcharts are discussed in
Chapter 13.)
Data flow diagrams: Data flow diagrams show the data or
information flow within an information system. The data is
traced from its origin through processing, storage, and
output. An example of a data flow diagram is shown in
Figure 12-8. The explanation of the symbols used appears in
Figure 12-9.

Automated design tools: Automated design tools are
software packages that evaluate hardware and software
alternatives according to requirements given by the systems
analyst. They are also called computer-aided software
engineering (CASE) tools. These tools are not limited to
systems analysis. They are used in systems design and
development as well. CASE tools relieve the systems
analysts of many repetitive tasks, develop clear
documentation, and, for larger projects, coordinate team
member activities.

Documenting Systems Analysis
In larger organizations, the systems analysis stage is
typically documented in a report for higher management. The
systems analysis report describes the current information
system, the requirements for a new system, and a possible
development schedule. For example, at Advantage Advertising,
the system flowcharts show the present flow of information in
a manual time-and-billing system. Some boxes in the system
flowchart might be replaced with symbols showing where a
computerized information system could work better.
Management studies the report and decides whether to
continue with the project. Let us assume your boss and higher
management have decided to continue. You now move on to Phase
3, systems design.

Phase 3 is systems design. It consists of three tasks: (1)
designing alternative systems, (2) selecting the best system,
and (3) writing a systems design report. (See Figure 12-10.)
Figure 12-10 Phase 3: Systems design
Designing Alternative Systems
In almost all instances, more than one design can be
developed to meet the information needs. Systems designers
evaluate each alternative system for feasibility. By
feasibility we mean three things:
Economic feasibility: Will the costs of the new system be
justified by the benefits it promises? How long will it
take for the new system to pay for itself?
Technical feasibility: Are reliable hardware, page 301
software, and training available to make the system
work? If not, can they be obtained?
reset page 715
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Operational feasibility: Can the system actually be made
to operate in the organization, or will people—employees,
managers, clients—resist it?
Selecting the Best System
When choosing the best design, managers must consider these
four questions: (1) Will the system work with the
organization’s overall information system? (2) Will the
system be flexible enough so it can be modified in the
future? (3) Can it be made secure against unauthorized use?
(4) Are the benefits worth the costs?
For example, one aspect you have to consider at Advantage
Advertising is security. Should freelancers and outside
vendors enter data directly into a computerized time-and-
billing system, or should they keep submitting time sheets
manually? In allowing these outside people to input
information directly, are you also allowing them access to
files they should not see? Do these files contain
confidential information, perhaps information of value to
rival advertising agencies?
Writing the Systems Design Report
The systems design report is prepared for higher management
and describes the alternative designs. It presents the costs
versus the benefits and outlines the effect of alternative
designs on the organization. It usually concludes by
recommending one of the alternatives.

Phase 4: Systems Development
Phase 4 is systems development. It has three steps: (1)
acquiring software, (2) acquiring hardware, and (3) testing
the new system. (See Figure 12-11.)
Figure 12-11 Phase 4: Systems development
Acquiring Software
Application software for the new information system can be
obtained in two ways. It can be purchased as off-the-shelf
packaged software and possibly modified, or it can be custom-
designed. If any of the software is being specially created,
reset page 717
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the programming steps we will outline in Chapter 13 should be
followed.
With the systems analyst’s help, you have looked at time-
and-billing packaged software designed for service
organizations. Unfortunately, you find that none of the
packaged software will do. Most of the packages seem to work
well for one person (you). However, none seems to be designed
for many people working together. It appears, then, that
software will have to be custom-designed. (We discuss the
process of developing software in Chapter 13, on
programming.)
Acquiring Hardware
Some new systems may not require new computer equipment, but
others will. The equipment needed and the places where they
are to be installed must be determined. This is a very
critical area. Switching or upgrading equipment can be a
tremendously expensive proposition. Will a personal computer
system be sufficient as a company grows? Are networks
expandable? Will people have to undergo costly training?
The systems analyst tells you that there are several
different makes and models of personal computers currently in
use at Advantage Advertising. Fortunately, all are connected
by a local area network to a file server that can hold the
time-and-billing data. To maintain security, the systems
analyst suggests that an electronic mailbox be installed for
freelancers and others outside the company. They can use this
electronic mailbox to post their time charges. Thus, it
appears that existing hardware will work just fine.

Testing the New System

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
After the software and equipment have been installed, the
system should be tested. Sample data is fed into the system.
The processed information is then evaluated to see whether
results are correct. Testing may take several months if the
new system is complex.
For this step, you ask some people in Creative Services to
test the system. (See Figure 12-12.) You observe that some of
the people have problems knowing where to enter their times.
To solve the problem, the software is modified to display an
improved user entry screen. After the system has been
thoroughly tested and revised as necessary, you are ready to
put it into use.

Phase 5: Systems Implementation
Another name for Phase 5, systems implementation, is
conversion. It is the process of changing—converting—from
the old system to the new one and training people to use the
new system.
Types of Conversion
There are four approaches to conversion: direct, parallel,
pilot, and phased.
In the direct approach, the conversion is done simply by
abandoning the old and starting up the new. This can be
risky. If anything is still wrong with the new system, the
old system is no longer available to fall back on.
The direct approach is not recommended precisely because
it is so risky. Problems, big or small, invariably crop up
in a new system. In a large system, a problem might just
mean catastrophe.
In the parallel approach, old and new systems are operated
side by side until the new one proves to be reliable.
This approach is low risk. If the new system fails, the
organization can just switch to the old system to keep
going. However, keeping enough equipment and people active
to manage two systems at the same time can be very
expensive. Thus, the parallel approach is used only in
cases in which the cost of failure or of interrupted
operation is great.
In the pilot approach, the new system is tried out in only
one part of the organization. Once the system is working
smoothly in that part, it is implemented throughout the
rest of the organization.
The pilot approach is certainly less expensive than the
parallel approach. It also is somewhat riskier. However,
reset page 720
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the risks can be controlled because problems will be
confined to only certain areas of the organization.
Difficulties will not affect the entire organization.
In the phased approach, the new system is page 304
implemented gradually over a period of time. The
entire implementation process is broken down into parts or
phases. Implementation begins with the first phase, and
once it is successfully implemented, the second phase
begins. This process continues until all phases are
operating smoothly. Typically, this is an expensive
proposition because the implementation is done slowly.
However, it is certainly one of the least risky approaches.
In general, the pilot and phased approaches are the
favored methods. Pilot is preferred when there are many
people in an organization performing similar operations—for
instance, all salesclerks in a department store. Phased is
more appropriate for organizations in which people are
performing different operations.
You and the systems analyst, with top management support,
have decided on a pilot implementation. This approach was
selected in part based on cost and the availability of a
representative group of users. The Creative Services
department previously tested the system and has expressed
enthusiastic support for it. A group from this department
will pilot the implementation of the time-and-billing system.
Training
Training people is important, of course. Unfortunately, it is
one of the most commonly overlooked activities. Some people
may begin training early, even before the equipment is
delivered, so that they can adjust more easily. In some
cases, a professional software trainer may be brought in to
show people how to operate the system. However, at Advantage
Advertising, the time-and-billing software is simple enough
that the systems analyst can act as the trainer.

Phase 6: Systems Maintenance
After implementation comes systems maintenance, the last
step in the systems life cycle. This phase is a very
important, ongoing activity. Most organizations spend more
time and money on this phase than on any of the others.
Maintenance has two parts: a systems audit and a periodic
evaluation.
In the systems audit, the system’s performance is
compared to the original design specifications. This is to
determine whether the new procedures are actually furthering
productivity. If they are not, some redesign may be
necessary.
After the systems audit, the new information system is
further modified, if necessary. All systems should be
evaluated from time to time to determine whether they are
meeting the goals and providing the service they are supposed
to.
The six-step systems life cycle is summarized in Figure
12-13.

Prototyping and Rapid
Applications
Development
Is it necessary to follow every phase of the systems life
cycle? It may be desirable, but often there is no time to do
so. For instance, hardware may change so fast that there is
no opportunity for evaluation, design, and testing as just
described. Two alternative approaches that require much less
time are prototyping and rapid applications development.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can be
modified before the actual system is installed. For instance,
the systems analyst for Advantage Advertising might develop a
reset page 723
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
proposed or prototype menu as a possible screen display for
the time-and-billing system. Users would try it out and
provide feedback to the systems analyst. The systems analyst
would revise the prototype until the users felt it was ready
to put into place. Typically, the development time for
prototyping is shorter; however, it is sometimes more
difficult to manage the project and to control costs. (See
Figure 12-14.)
Figure 12-14 Micro Focus offers prototyping software
Justinmind
Rapid Applications Development
Rapid applications development (RAD) involves the use of
powerful development software, small specialized teams, and
highly trained personnel. For example, the systems analyst
for Advantage Advertising would use specialized development
software like CASE, form small teams consisting of select
users and managers, and obtain assistance from other highly
qualified analysts. Although the resulting time-and-billing
system would likely cost more, the development time would be
shorter and the quality of the completed system would be
better.

them. Analysts follow the systems life cycle through all of
its steps: preliminary investigation, analysis, design,
development, implementation, and maintenance.

Systems analyst positions normally require either an
advanced associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree in
computer science or information systems and technical
experience. Internships and prior experience with the
latest technology are a considerable advantage for those
seeking jobs in this industry. Systems analysts can expect
to earn an annual salary of $48,000 to $95,000.
Opportunities for advancement include positions as a chief

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The Challenge of Keeping Pace
Have you noticed the speed with which new (or competing) products and
services are being released? Does your favorite website change often to
keep up with its competitors? Most observers firmly believe that the pace
of business is accelerating. The time to develop a product and bring it to
market, in many cases, is now months rather than years. Internet
technologies, in particular, have provided tools to support the rapid
introduction of new products and services. Technology has been making
better business tools, and will continue to evolve to improve our lives as
we look to the future.
reset page 726
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

To stay competitive, corporations must integrate these new technologies
into their existing ways of doing business. In many cases, the traditional
systems life cycle approach takes too long—sometimes years—to develop a
system. Many organizations are responding by aggressively implementing
prototyping and RAD. Others are enlisting the services of outside
consulting groups that specialize in systems development. However, many
experts believe that the future of life cycle management lies in relying
on the cloud—businesses will turn to companies that offer both processing
and software as a service, rather than hosting these systems on their own.
In the future, many companies will no longer have large servers and
database systems under their own roof. They will instead pay a monthly fee
to a company, such as Amazon, that has large data centers that are
accessible via the Internet. These data centers offer security and
reliability, and they can grow, or scale, based on the needs of the
business. The systems analyst of the future will not have to worry about
the hardware requirements of a new piece of software or database
management system. The implementation of new systems will be much easier,
for both the business and its customers. All hardware upgrades will now be
managed by the company offering the cloud service, and the software will
be hosted there. Of course, all this requires a good communications
infrastructure—one that is being improved each year by telecommunications
companies.
What do you think about moving so many aspects of a system to the
cloud? Is there a danger in trusting another company with your business’s
data? Do you think cloud computing will enable a business to release
reliable products more quickly and at a lower cost?

Systems Analysis
VISUAL SUMMARY
and Design
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
A system is a collection of activities and elements
organized to accomplish a goal. Systems analysis and
design is a six-phase problem-solving procedure that
makes up the systems life cycle. The phases are
Preliminary investigation—identifying organization’s
problems or needs and summarizing in short report.
Systems analysis—studying present system in depth,
specifying new requirements, and documenting findings.
Systems design—designing new or alternative system to
meet new requirements and creating a design report.
reset page 728
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems development—acquiring, developing, and testing
needed hardware and software.
Systems implementation—installing new system and
training people.
Systems maintenance—periodically evaluating and
updating system as needed.
Systems analysts are the computer professionals who
typically follow the six-phase systems life cycle.
PHASE 1: PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION
The preliminary investigation determines the need for a
new information system. It is typically requested by an
end user or a manager. Three tasks of this phase are
defining the problem, suggesting alternative systems, and
preparing a short report.
Defining the Problem
The current information system is examined to determine
who needs what information, when the information is
needed, and why it is needed.
reset page 729
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If the existing information system is large, then a
systems analyst conducts the survey. Otherwise, the end
user conducts the survey.
Suggesting Alternative Systems
Some possible alternative systems are suggested. Based on
interviews and observations made in defining the problem,
alternative information systems are identified.
Preparing a Short Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 1,
preliminary investigation, a short report is prepared and
presented to management.
page 309
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand the importance of systems analysis and
design. You need to know the six phases of the systems
development life cycle: preliminary investigation,
analysis, design, development, implementation, and
maintenance. Additionally, you need to understand
prototyping and RAD.
PHASE 2: SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
reset page 730
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In systems analysis, data is collected about the present
system. The focus is on determining the requirements for
a new system. Three tasks of this phase are gathering
data, analyzing the data, and documenting the analysis.
Gathering Data
Data is gathered by observation, interviews,
questionnaires, and looking at documents. One helpful
document is the organization chart, which shows a
company’s functions and levels of management.
Analyzing the Data
There are several tools for the analysis of data,
including top-down analysis, grid charts, and system
flowcharts.
Documenting Systems Analysis
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 2, a
systems analysis report is prepared for higher
management.

PHASE 3: SYSTEMS DESIGN
In the systems design phase, a new or alternative
information system is designed. This phase consists of
three tasks:
Designing Alternative Systems
Alternative information systems are designed. Each
alternative is evaluated for
Economic feasibility—cost versus benefits; time for
the system to pay for itself.
reset page 732
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Technical feasibility—hardware and software
reliability; available training.
Operational feasibility—will the system work within
the organization?
Selecting the Best System
Four questions should be considered when selecting the
best system:
Will the system fit into an overall information system?
Will the system be flexible enough to be modified as
needed in the future?
Will it be secure against unauthorized use?
Will the system’s benefits exceed its costs?
Writing the Systems Design Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 3, a
systems design report is prepared for higher management.

PHASE 4: SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT
reset page 733
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
In the systems development phase, software and hardware
are acquired and tested.
Acquiring Software
Two ways to acquire software are purchasing off-the-shelf
packaged software and designing custom programs.
Acquiring Hardware
Acquiring hardware involves consideration for future
company growth, existing networks, communication
capabilities, and training.
Testing the New System
Using sample data, the new system is tested. This step
can take several months for a complex system.

PHASE 5: SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION
Systems implementation, also known as conversion, is
the process of changing to the new system and training
people.
Types of Conversion
reset page 735
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Four ways to convert are direct, parallel, pilot, and
phased approaches.
Direct approach—abandoning the old system and
starting up the new system; can be very risky and not
recommended.
Parallel approach—running the old and new side by
side until the new system proves its worth; very low
risk; however, very expensive; not generally
recommended.
Pilot approach—converting only one part of the
organization to the new system until the new system
proves its worth; less expensive but riskier than
parallel conversion; recommended for situations with
many people performing similar operations.
Phased approach—gradually implementing the new system
to the entire organization; less risky but more
expensive than parallel conversion; recommended for
situations with many people performing different
operations.
Training
Training is important, but often overlooked. Some people
may train early as the equipment is being delivered so
that they can adjust more easily. Sometimes a
professional trainer is used; other times the systems
analyst acts as the trainer.

PHASE 6: SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE
reset page 736
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Systems maintenance consists of a systems audit followed
by periodic evaluation.
Systems Audit
Once the system is operational, the systems analyst
performs a systems audit by comparing the new system to
its original design specifications.
Periodic Evaluation
The new system is periodically evaluated to ensure that
it is operating efficiently.
Phase Activity
1. Preliminary Define problem, suggest alternatives, prepare
investigation short report

PROTOTYPING AND RAD
Justinmind
Due to time pressures, it is not always feasible to
follow every phase of the systems life cycle. Two
alternatives that require less time are prototyping and
RAD.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can
be modified before the actual system is installed.
Typically, the development time for prototyping is
shorter; however, it can be more difficult to manage the
project and to control costs.
Rapid Applications Development
reset page 738
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Rapid applications development (RAD) uses powerful
development software, small specialized teams, and highly
trained personnel. Typically, the development costs more.
However, the time is much less and the quality is often
better.
CAREERS in IT
Systems analysts plan and design new systems or
reorganize a company’s computer resources to better
utilize them. They follow the systems life cycle through
all its steps. Either an advanced associate’s degree or
a bachelor’s degree in computer science or information
systems and technical experience are required. Expected
salary range is $48,000 to $95,000.
