Why should I read this chapter?
Giant databases are recording your every digital action, from credit card
purchases to Facebook check-ins. These databases can be used to tailor
advertisements to your interests, predict your credit score, and even
assess your safety at home. In the future, databases with DNA records of
all U.S. citizens and every digital activity of a city may be able to
predict crime and even identify likely criminals.

Like a library, secondary storage is designed to store information. How is
this stored information organized? What are databases, and why do you need
to know anything about them?
Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island with
only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, through
communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct
electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.
In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They
are an important part of nearly every organization, including schools,
hospitals, and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need
to know how to find information and understand how it is stored.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
data fields, records, tables, and databases. You need to be aware of the
different ways in which a database can be structured and the different
types of databases. Also, you need to know the most important database
uses and issues.
Data
As we have discussed throughout this book, information
systems consist of people, procedures, software, hardware,
data, and the Internet. This chapter focuses on data, which
can be defined as facts or observations about people, places,
things, and events. More specifically, this chapter focuses
on how databases store, organize, and use data.
Not long ago, data was limited to numbers, letters, and
symbols recorded by keyboards. Now, data is much richer and
includes
reset page 652
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Audio captured, interpreted, and saved using microphones
and voice recognition systems.
Music downloaded from the Internet and saved on cell
phones, tablets, and other devices.
Photographs captured by digital cameras, edited by image
editing software, and shared with others over the Internet.
Video captured by digital video cameras, TV tuner cards,
and webcams.
There are two ways, or perspectives, to view data. These
perspectives are the physical view and the logical view. The
physical view focuses on the actual format and location of
the data. As discussed in Chapter 5, data is recorded as
digital bits that are typically grouped together into bytes
that represent characters using a coding scheme such as
Unicode. Typically, only very specialized computer
professionals are concerned with the physical view. The other
perspective, the logical view, focuses on the meaning,
content, and context of the data. End users and most computer
professionals are concerned with this view. They are involved
with actually using the data with application programs. This
chapter presents the logical view of data and how data is
stored in databases.

Data Organization
The first step in understanding databases is to learn how
data is organized. In the logical view, data is organized
into groups or categories. Each group is more complex than
the one before. (See Figure 11-1.)
Character: A character is the most basic logical data
element. It is a single letter, number, or special
character, such as a punctuation mark, or a symbol, such as
$.
Field: The next higher level is a field, or group of
related characters. In our example, Brown is in the data
field for the Last Name of an employee. It consists of the
individual letters (characters) that make up the last name.
A data field represents an attribute (description or
characteristic) of some entity (person, place, thing, or
object). For example, an employee is an entity with many
attributes, including his or her last name.
Record: A record is a collection of related fields. A
record represents a collection of attributes that describe
an entity. In our example, the payroll record for an
employee consists of the data fields describing the
attributes for one employee. These attributes are First
Name, Last Name, Employee ID, and Salary.
Table: A table is a collection of related records. For
example, the Payroll Table would include payroll
information (records) for the employees (entities).
Database: A database is an integrated collection page 272
of logically related tables. For example, the
Personnel Database would include all related employee
tables, including the Payroll Table and the Benefits Table.

Description
Key Field
Each record in a table has at least one distinctive field,
called the key field. Also known as the primary key, this
field uniquely identifies the record. Tables can be related
or connected to other tables by common key fields.
For most employee databases, a key field is an employee
identification number. Key fields in different tables can be
used to integrate the data in a database. For example, in the
Personnel Database, both the Payroll and the Benefits tables
include the field Employee ID. Data from the two tables could
be related by combining all records with the same key field
(Employee ID).
Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways. These
are batch processing, or what we might call “later,” and
reset page 655
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
real-time processing, or what we might call “now.” These
two methods have been used to handle common record-keeping
activities such as payroll and sales orders.
Batch processing: In batch processing, data is collected
over several hours, days, or even weeks. It is then
processed all at once as a “batch.” If you have a credit
card, your bill probably reflects batch processing. That
is, during the month, you buy things and charge them to
your credit card. Each time you charge something, an
electronic copy of the transaction is sent to the credit
card company. At some point in the month, the company’s
data processing department puts all those transactions (and
those of many other customers) together and processes them
at one time. The company then sends you a single bill
totaling the amount you owe. (See Figure 11-2.)
Real-time processing: Real-time processing, also page 273
known as online processing, occurs when data is
processed at the same time the transaction occurs. For
example, whenever you request funds at an ATM, real-time
processing occurs. After you have provided account
information and requested a specific withdrawal, the
bank’s computer verifies that you have sufficient funds in
your account. If you do, then the funds are dispensed to
you, and the bank immediately updates the balance of your
account. (See Figure 11-3.)

Databases
Many organizations have multiple files on the same subject or
person. For example, a customer’s name and address could
appear in different files within the sales department,
billing department, and credit department. This is called
data redundancy. If the customer moves, then the address in
each file must be updated. If one or more files are
overlooked, problems will likely result. For example, a
product ordered might be sent to the new address, but the
bill might be sent to the old address. This situation results
from a lack of data integrity.
page 274
Moreover, data spread around in different files is not as
useful. The marketing department, for instance, might want to
offer special promotions to customers who order large
quantities of merchandise. To identify these customers, the
marketing department would need to obtain permission and
access to files in the billing department. It would be much
reset page 658
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
more efficient if all data were in a common database. A
database can make the needed information available.
Need for Databases
For an organization, there are many advantages to having
databases:
Sharing: In organizations, information from one department
can be readily shared with others. Billing could let
marketing know which customers ordered large quantities of
merchandise.
Security: Users are given passwords or access only to the
kind of information they need. Thus, the payroll department
may have access to employees’ pay rates, but other
departments would not.
Less data redundancy: Without a common database,
individual departments have to create and maintain their
own data, and data redundancy results. For example, an
employee’s home address would likely appear in several
files. Redundant data causes inefficient use of storage
space and data maintenance problems.
Data integrity: When there are multiple sources of data,
each source may have variations. A customer’s address may
be listed as “Main Street” in one system and “Main St.”
in another. With discrepancies like these, it is probable
that the customer would be treated as two separate people.
Database Management
In order to create, modify, and gain access to a database,
special software is required. This software is called a
database management system, which is commonly abbreviated
DBMS.
Some DBMSs, such as Microsoft Access, are designed
specifically for personal computers. Other DBMSs are designed
for specialized database servers. DBMS software is made up of
reset page 659
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
five parts or subsystems: DBMS engine, data definition, data
manipulation, application generation, and data
administration.
The DBMS engine provides a bridge between the logical view
of the data and the physical view of the data. When users
request data (logical perspective), the DBMS engine handles
the details of actually locating the data (physical
perspective).
The data definition subsystem defines the logical
structure of the database by using a data dictionary or
schema. This dictionary contains a description of the
structure of data in the database. For a particular item of
data, it defines the names used for a particular field. It
defines the type of data for each field (text, numeric,
time, graphic, audio, and video). An example of an Access
data dictionary form is presented in Figure 11-4.
The data manipulation subsystem provides tools for
maintaining and analyzing data. Maintaining data is known
as data maintenance. It involves adding new data, deleting
old data, and editing existing data. Analysis tools support
viewing all or selected parts of the data, querying the
database, and generating reports. Specific tools include
query-by-example and a specialized programming language
called structured query language (SQL). (Structured query
language and other types of programming languages will be
discussed in Chapter 13.)
The application generation subsystem provides tools to
create data entry forms and specialized programming
languages that interface or work with common and page 275
widely used programming languages such as C++ or
Visual Basic. See Figure 11-5 for a data entry form created
by the application generation subsystem in Access.
The data administration subsystem helps to manage the
overall database, including maintaining security, providing
reset page 660
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
disaster recovery support, and monitoring the overall
performance of database operations. Larger organizations
typically employ highly trained computer specialists,
called database administrators (DBAs), to interact with
the data administration subsystem. Additional duties of
database administrators include determining processing
rights or determining which people have access to what
kinds of data in the database.

DBMS Structure
reset page 662
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
DBMS programs are designed to work with data that is
logically structured or arranged in a particular way. This
arrangement is known as the database model. These models
define rules and standards for all the data in a database.
For example, Microsoft Access is designed to work with
databases using the relational data model. Five common
database models are hierarchical, network, relational,
multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
At one time, nearly every DBMS designed for mainframes used
the hierarchical data model. In a hierarchical database,
fields or records are structured in nodes. Nodes are points
connected like the branches of an upside-down tree. Each
entry has one parent node, although a parent may have several
child nodes. This is sometimes described as a one-to-many
relationship. To find a particular field, you have to start
at the top with a parent and trace down the tree to a child.
The nodes farther down the system are subordinate to the
ones above, like the hierarchy of managers in a corporation.
An example of a hierarchical database is a system to organize
music files. (See Figure 11-6.) The parent node is the music
library for a particular user. This parent has page 277
four children, labeled “artist.” Coldplay, one
of the children, has three children of its own. They are
labeled “album.” The Greatest Hits album has three
children, labeled “song.”
reset page 663
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 11-6 Hierarchical database
Description
The problem with a hierarchical database is that if one
parent node is deleted, so are all the subordinate child
nodes. Moreover, a child node cannot be added unless a parent
node is added first. The most significant limitation is the
rigid structure: one parent only per child, and no
relationships or connections between the child nodes
themselves.
Network Database
Responding to the limitations of the hierarchical data model,
network models were developed. A network database also has a
hierarchical arrangement of nodes. However, each child node
may have more than one parent node. This is sometimes
described as a many-to-many relationship. There are
additional connections—called pointers—between parent nodes
reset page 664
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
and child nodes. Thus, a node may be reached through more
than one path. It may be traced down through different
branches.
For example, a university could use this type of
organization to record students taking classes. (See Figure
11-7.) If you trace through the logic of this organization,
you can see that each student can have more than one teacher.
Each teacher also can teach more than one course. Students
may take more than a single course. This demonstrates how the
network arrangement is more flexible and, in many cases, more
efficient than the hierarchical arrangement.
Figure 11-7 Network database
Description
Relational Database
The most common type of organization is the relational
database. In this structure, there are no access paths down a
hierarchy. Rather, the data elements are stored in different
tables, each of which consists of rows and columns. A table
and its data are called a relation.
An example of a relational database is shown in Figure 11-
8. The Vehicle Owner Table contains license numbers, names,
reset page 665
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
and addresses for all registered drivers. Within the table, a
row is a record containing information about one driver. Each
column is a field. The fields are License Number, Last Name,
First Name, Street, City, State, and Zip. All related tables
must have a common data item, or shared key field, in both
tables, enabling information stored in one table to be linked
with information stored in another. In this case, the three
tables are related by the License Number field.

Police officers who stop a speeding car look up the
driver’s information in the Department of Motor Vehicles
database (Figure 11-9) using the driver’s license number.
They also can check for any unpaid traffic violations in the
Outstanding Citations Table. Finally, if the officers suspect
that the car is stolen, they can look up what vehicles the
driver owns in the Vehicle Table.

The most valuable feature of relational databases is their
simplicity. Entries can be easily added, deleted, and
modified. The hierarchical and network databases are more
rigid. The relational organization is common for personal
computer DBMSs such as Access. Relational databases are also
widely used for mainframe and midrange systems.
Multidimensional Database
The multidimensional data model is a variation and an
extension of the relational data model. Whereas relational
databases use tables consisting of rows and columns,
multidimensional databases extend this two-dimensional data
reset page 667
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
model to include additional or multiple dimensions, sometimes
called a data cube. Data can be viewed as a cube having three
or more sides and consisting of cells. Each side of the cube
is considered a dimension of the data. In this way, complex
relationships between data can be represented and efficiently
analyzed.
page 279
Multidimensional databases provide several advantages over
relational databases. Two of the most significant advantages
are
Conceptualization: Multidimensional databases and data
cubes provide users with an intuitive model in which
complex data and relationships can be analyzed without
specialized database programming knowledge.
Processing speed: Analyzing and querying a large
multidimensional database can be much faster. For example,
a query requiring just a few seconds on a multidimensional
database could take minutes or hours to perform on a
relational database.
Object-Oriented Database
The other data structures are primarily designed to access
and summarize structured data such as names, addresses, pay
rates, and so on. Object-oriented databases are more
flexible and store data as well as instructions to manipulate
the data. Additionally, this structure is ideally designed to
provide input for object-oriented software development, which
is described in Chapter 13.
Object-oriented databases organize data using classes,
objects, attributes, and methods.
Classes are general definitions.
reset page 668
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Objects are specific instances of a class that can contain
both data and instructions to manipulate the data.
Attributes are the data fields an object possesses.
Methods are instructions for retrieving or manipulating
attribute values.
For example, a health club might use an object-oriented
employment database. (See Figure 11-10.) The database uses a
class, Employee, to define employee objects that are stored
in the database. This definition includes the attributes
First name, Last name, Address, and Wage and the method Pay.
Bob, Sarah, and Omar are objects each with specific
attributes designated by their object type. For example, Bob
is an employee and an accountant. Bob has attributes common
to all employees, such as a name and address. He also has
attributes unique to accountants, such as his certification
as a public accountant. Different objects use different
methods to determine some information. For example,
accountants earn an annual salary, while salespeople earn an
hourly wage as well as a commission.

databases known as NoSQL. For a summary of DBMS organization,

Types of Databases
Databases may be small or large, limited in accessibility or
widely accessible. Databases may be classified into four
types: individual, company, distributed, and commercial.
Individual
The individual database is also called a personal computer
database. It is a collection of integrated files primarily
used by just one person. Typically, the data and the DBMS are
under the direct control of the user. They are stored either
on the user’s hard-disk drive or on a LAN file server.
There may be many times in your life when you will find
this kind of database valuable. If you are in sales, for
instance, a personal computer database can be used to keep
track of your customers. If you are a sales manager, you can
keep track of your salespeople and their performance. If you
are an advertising account executive, you can keep track of
your different projects and how many hours to charge each
client.
Company
Companies, of course, create databases for their own use. The
company database may be stored on a central database server
and managed by a database administrator. Users throughout the
company have access to the database through their personal
computers linked to local or wide area networks.
As we discussed in Chapter 10, company databases are the
foundation for management information systems. For instance,
a department store can record all sales transactions in the
database. A sales manager can use this information to see
which salespeople are selling the most products. The manager
can then determine year-end sales bonuses. Or the store’s
buyer can learn which products are selling well or not
reset page 671
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
selling and make adjustments when reordering. A top executive
might combine overall store sales trends with information
from outside databases about consumer and page 281
population trends. This information could be used
to change the whole merchandising strategy of the store.
Distributed
Many times the data in a company is stored not in just one
location but in several locations. It is made accessible
through a variety of communications networks. The database,
then, is a distributed database. That is, not all the data
in a database is physically located in one place. Typically,
database servers on a client/server network provide the link
between the data.
For instance, some database information can be at regional
offices. Some can be at company headquarters, some down the
hall from you, and some even overseas. Sales figures for a
chain of department stores, then, could be located at the
various stores. But executives at district offices or at the
chain’s headquarters could have access to all these figures.
Commercial
A commercial database is generally an enormous database that
an organization develops to cover particular subjects. It
offers access to this database to the public or selected
outside individuals for a fee. Sometimes commercial databases
also are called information utilities or data banks. An
example is Factiva, which offers a variety of information-
gathering and reporting services. (See Figure 11-12.)

technical and scientific information.
Dow Jones Factiva—provides world news and information on
business, investments, and stocks.
LexisNexis—offers news and information on legal news,
public records, and business issues.
Most of the commercial databases are designed for
organizational as well as individual use. Organizations
typically pay a membership fee plus hourly use fees. Often,
individuals are able to search the database to obtain a
summary of available information without charge. They pay
only for those items selected for further investigation.

databases.

Database Uses and Issues
Databases offer great opportunities for productivity. In
fact, in corporate libraries, electronic databases are now
considered more valuable than books and journals. However,
maintaining databases means users must make constant efforts
to keep them from being tampered with or misused.
Strategic Uses
Databases help users to keep up to date and to plan for the
future. To support the needs of managers and other business
professionals, many organizations collect data from a variety
reset page 674
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
of internal and external databases. This data is then stored
in a special type of database called a data warehouse. A
technique called data mining is often used to search these
databases to look for related information and patterns.
Hundreds of databases are available to help users with
both general and specific business purposes, including
Business directories providing addresses, financial and
marketing information, products, and trade and brand names.
Demographic data, such as county and city statistics,
current estimates on population and income, employment
statistics, census data, and so on.
Business statistical information, such as financial
information on publicly traded companies, market potential
of certain retail stores, and other business data and
information.
Text databases providing articles from business
publications, press releases, reviews on companies and
products, and so on.
Web databases covering a wide range of topics, including
all of those previously mentioned. As mentioned earlier,
web search sites like Google maintain extensive databases
of available Internet content.
Security
Precisely because databases are so valuable, their security
has become a critical issue. As we discussed in Chapter 9,
there are several database security concerns. One concern is
that personal and private information about people stored in
databases may be used for the wrong purposes. For page 283
instance, a person’s credit history or medical
records might be used to make hiring or promotion decisions.
Another concern is unauthorized users gaining access to a
database. For example, there have been numerous instances in
reset page 675
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
which a computer virus has been launched into a database or
network.
Security may require putting guards in company computer
rooms and checking the identification of everyone admitted.
Some security systems electronically check fingerprints. (See
Figure 11-14.) Security is particularly important to
organizations using WANs. Violations can occur without
actually entering secured areas. As mentioned in previous
chapters, most major corporations today use special hardware
and software called firewalls to control access to their
internal networks.

Database administrators use database management software
to determine the most efficient ways to organize and access
a company’s data. Additionally, database administrators
are typically responsible for maintaining database security
and backing up the system. Database administration is a
fast-growing industry, and substantial job growth is
expected.
Database administrator positions normally require a
bachelor’s degree in computer science or information
systems and technical experience. Internships and prior
experience with the latest technology are a considerable
advantage for those seeking jobs in this industry. It is
possible to transfer skills learned in one industry, such
as finance, to a new career in database administration. In
order to accomplish this objective, many people seek
additional training in computer science.
Database administrators can expect to earn an annual
salary of $47,000 to $111,000. Opportunities for

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The Future of Crime Databases
Have you ever imagined a world without violent crime? What would you be
willing to do (or give up) if your government could guarantee that all
potential criminals could be stopped before they commit their crime?
Recently, we are close to making this possible through large and powerful
databases, along with computer programs that can analyze data and make
predictions. The tricky part is that the databases require a significant
amount of personal information from everyone who lives in the country.
Technology has been making better crime databases and will continue to
evolve to improve our lives as we look to the future.
Currently, national crime databases in several countries, such as the
United States, focus on keeping data about individuals that have committed
crimes. Not only do these databases contain basic information such as name
and date of birth, they also contain fingerprints, photos, and even DNA
samples. This makes it easier to figure out who committed a crime after it
happens, assuming the criminal is already in the database. Although the
offender will eventually be caught, it is too late for the innocent
victim. For this reason, researchers are currently looking into the
possibility of expanding the collection of data and then using powerful
programs to figure out who is capable of committing violent crimes in the
future.
reset page 678
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

Over the last few years, various research institutions have been
looking into patterns that could predict criminal behavior. They analyze
data ranging from childhood abuse to current employment status. Their goal
is to find a combination of factors that usually leads to violent,
criminal behavior. Other researchers are looking deep into human DNA,
looking for any sequences that could be connected to antisocial or violent
behavior. If such patterns could be found, then all we need to do is find
the individuals who have these characteristics. The problem is that not
all these individuals have an entry in the national crime database.
Furthermore, these databases do not contain data about every aspect of a
person’s life. That, however, could change.
Over the years, criminal databases have been expanding. However, in the
United States, each state has the ability to determine the data to be
collected and from whom it will be collected. Whereas one state might take
a DNA sample from only violent criminals and sex offenders, another state
might collect that data from someone who committed a misdemeanor. If a
future crime database is to make predictions, law enforcement will have to
take DNA samples from every person living in the United States.
Furthermore, the government will need access to all databases that contain
information about that person—including databases from schools,
businesses, insurance companies, and medical practices. Only then can
these future programs be able to predict which individuals have the sort
of patterns that may lead to future criminal behavior. Once those
individuals are spotted, law enforcement could be authorized to monitor
them closely or perhaps even intervene with psychological or medical
assistance.
Supposing a crime-predicting program could be developed, there will be
legal challenges to the type of data collection required. Individuals will
be asked to weigh their privacy against the possibility of reducing crime.
Inevitably, our trust of the government will also come into play. What do
you think about this sort of future database? Would you trust the

government with all this personal and biological information? Do you
believe it is worth giving up privacy for the sake of having security?

VISUAL SUMMARY
Databases
DATA ORGANIZATION
Data is organized by the following groups:
Character—the most basic logical element, consisting
of individual numbers, letters, and special characters.
Field—next level, consisting of a set of related
characters, for example, a person’s last name. A data
field represents an attribute (description or
reset page 680
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
characteristic) of some entity (person, place, thing,
or object).
Record—a collection of related fields; for example, a
payroll record consisting of fields of data relating to
one employee.
Table—a collection of related records; for example, a
payroll table consisting of all the employee records.
Database—an integrated collection of related tables;
for example, a personnel database contains all related
employee tables.
Key Field
A key field (primary key) is the field in a record that
uniquely identifies each record.
Tables can be related (connected) to other tables by
key fields.
Key fields in different files can be used to integrate
the data in a database.
Common key fields are employee ID numbers and driver’s
license numbers.
DATA ORGANIZATION
Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways:
batch or real-time processing.
reset page 681
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Batch processing—data is collected over time and then
processed later all at one time (batched). For example,
monthly credit card bills are typically created by
processing credit card purchases throughout the past
month.
Real-time processing (online processing)—data is
processed at the same time the transaction occurs;
direct access storage devices make real-time processing
possible. For example, a request for cash using an ATM
machine initiates a verification of funds, approval or
disapproval, disbursement of cash, and an update of the
account balance.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand data fields, records, tables, and
databases. You need to be aware of the different ways
in which a database can be structured and the different
types of databases. Also, you need to know the most
important database uses and issues.

A database is a collection of integrated data—logically
related files and records.
Need for Databases
Advantages of databases are sharing data, improved
security, reduced data redundancy, and higher data
integrity.
Database Management
A database management system (DBMS) is the software for
creating, modifying, and gaining access to the database.
A DBMS consists of five subsystems:
DBMS engine provides a bridge between logical and
physical data views.
Data definition subsystem defines the logical
structure of a database using a data dictionary or
schema.
Data manipulation subsystem provides tools for data
maintenance and data analysis; tools include query-by-
example and structured query language (SQL).
Application generation subsystem provides tools for
creating data entry forms with specialized programming
reset page 683
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
languages.
Data administration subsystem manages the database;
database administrators (DBAs) are computer
professionals who help define processing rights.
DBMS STRUCTURE
DBMS programs are designed to work with specific data
structures or database models. These models define rules
and standards for all the data in the database. Five
principal database models are hierarchical, network,
relational, multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
Hierarchical database uses nodes to link and structure
fields and records; entries may have one parent node
with several child nodes in a one-to-many relationship.
Network Database
Network database is like hierarchical except a child
node may have more than one parent in a many-to-many
relationship; additional connections are called
pointers.
Relational Database
reset page 684
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Relational database data is stored in tables
(relations); related tables must have a common data item
(key field). A table and its data are called a relation.

Multidimensional Database
reset page 685
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Multidimensional databases extend two-dimensional
relational tables to three or more dimensions, sometimes
called a data cube.
Multidimensional databases tend to be more flexible
and intuitive than relational databases.
Object-Oriented Database
Object-oriented databases store data, instructions, and
unstructured data. Data is organized using
Classes are general definitions.
Objects are specific instances of a class that can
contain both data and instructions to manipulate the
data.
Attributes are the data fields an object possesses.
Methods are instructions for retrieving or
manipulating attribute values.
Object-oriented databases are part of a new category of
databases known as NoSQL.
TYPES OF DATABASES

Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
There are four types of databases:
Individual (personal computer) database: Used by one
person.
Company database: Stored on central server; accessed
by multiple people.
Distributed database: Spread out geographically;
accessed by communications links.
Commercial databases (information utilities and data
banks): Enormous; for particular subjects.
DATABASE USES AND ISSUES
Databases offer a great opportunity for increased
productivity; however, security is always a concern.
Strategic Uses
Data warehouses support data mining. Data mining is a
technique for searching and exploring databases for
related information and patterns.
Security
Two important security concerns are illegal use of data
and unauthorized access. Most organizations use
reset page 687
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
firewalls to protect their internal networks.
CAREERS in IT
Database administrators use database management software
to determine the most efficient ways to organize and
access a company’s data. They are also responsible for
database security and system backup. A bachelor’s degree
in computer science or information systems and technical
experience are required. Expected salary range is $47,000
to $111,000.
