Why should I read this chapter?
Your cell phone can receive automatic software updates over the Internet,
but there are many software improvements that require you, the user, to
take action. In the future, software may diagnose and repair problems
much like your body’s immune system protects your health. But for now,
your computers are at risk from dangerous viruses and software failures.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Ray, and I’m a computer support specialist. I’d
like to talk with you about system software, programs that do a
lot of the work behind the scenes so that your electronic devices
keep running smoothly. I’d also like to talk about the mobile
operating systems that control cell phones and other small
portable computers.”

When most people use a computer, they use a cell phone to send messages,
play games, or view social media. We typically think of using a computer
as using the applications that have become an important part of our
everyday lives. Most of us agree that they are great … as long as they
are working.
We usually do not think about the more mundane and behind-the-scenes
computer activities: loading and running programs, coordinating networks
that share resources, organizing files, protecting us from viruses,
performing periodic maintenance to avoid problems, and controlling
hardware devices so that they can communicate with one another. Typically,
these activities go on behind the scenes without our help.
That is the way it should be, and the way it is, as long as everything
is working perfectly. But what if new application programs are not
compatible and will not run on our current computer system? What if we get
a computer virus? What if our hard disk fails? What if we buy a new
digital video camera and can’t store and edit the images on our computer
system? What if our computer starts to run slower and slower?
These issues may seem mundane, but they are critical. This chapter
covers the vital activities that go on behind the scenes. A little
knowledge about these activities can go a long way to making your
computing life easier. To efficiently and effectively use computers, you
need to understand the functionality of system software, including
operating systems, utility programs, and device drivers.
System Software
End users use application software to accomplish specific
tasks. For example, we use messaging applications to send
text and photos with our cell phones. However, end users also
reset page 236
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
use system software. System software works with end users,
application software, and computer hardware to handle the
majority of technical details. For example, system software
controls where a word processing program is stored in memory,
how commands are converted so that the system unit can
process them, and where a completed document or file is
saved. (See Figure 4-1.)

Description
System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a
collection or a system of programs that handle hundreds of
reset page 237
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
technical details with little or no user intervention. System
software consists of four types of programs:
Operating systems coordinate computer resources, provide an
interface between users and the computer, and run
applications.
Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing
computer resources.
Device drivers are specialized programs that allow
particular input or output devices to communicate with the
rest of the computer system.
Language translators convert the programming instructions
written by programmers into a language that computers
understand and process.
page 87
Operating Systems
An operating system is a collection of programs that handle
many of the technical details related to using a computer. In
many ways, an operating system is the most important type of
computer program. Without a functioning operating system,
your computer would be useless.
ethics
As our devices have gotten smarter, their operating systems have begun
accepting voice commands. This allows a user to speak commands to the
device. A device may be controlled by speaking a key phrase—such as
“OK Google,” “Hey Siri,” or “Alexa”—followed by a command or
question, such as “what time is it?” In order for the device to
recognize when a user says the device’s key phrase, it must always be
reset page 238
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
recording and analyzing users’ conversations. These recordings are
often shared over the Internet with companies that use this information
to improve the voice recognition software and search tools. Could such
data be used unethically? Who should oversee this data, and what limits
should be placed on its use?
Functions
Every computer has an operating system, and every operating
system performs a variety of functions. These functions can
be classified into three groups:
Managing resources: Operating systems coordinate all the
computer’s resources, including memory, processing,
storage, and devices such as printers and monitors. They
also monitor system performance, schedule tasks, provide
security, and start up the computer.
Providing user interface: Operating systems allow users to
interact with application programs and computer hardware
through a user interface. Originally, operating systems
used a character-based interface in which users
communicated with the operating system through written
commands such as “Copy A: report.txt C:”. Today, most
operating systems use a graphical user interface (GUI). As
we discussed in Chapter 3, a graphical user interface uses
graphical elements such as icons and windows. More
recently, many operating systems now include voice assist
tools. Much like a graphical user interface offers users a
visual way to interact with application programs page 88
and computer hardware, voice assist tools allows a
user to directly issue voice commands.
Running applications: Operating systems load and run
applications such as word processors and spreadsheets. Most
operating systems support multitasking, or the ability to
switch between different applications stored in memory.
With multitasking, you could have a web browser and a
messaging app running at the same time and switch easily
reset page 239
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
between the two applications. The program that you are
currently working on is described as running in the
foreground. The other program or programs are running in
the background.
community
Did you know that your operating system plays a key role in making sure
that everybody has access to technology? All major operating systems
include accessibility features that make our devices easier to use for
people with disabilities. For people with low vision, there are tools
to magnify portions of the screen or read written text out loud. For
people with dyslexia, there are fonts that can make identifying letters
and words easier. For the deaf or hard of hearing, audible alerts can
be set to also offer visual cues, like flashing the screen when a beep
or noise is played. These features are included free in your device’s
operating system, and you can configure them in your device’s settings
menus.
Features
Starting or restarting a computer is called booting the
system. There are two ways to boot a computer: a warm boot
and a cold boot. A warm boot occurs when the computer is
already on and you restart it without turning off the power.
A warm boot can be accomplished in several ways. For many
computer systems, they can be restarted by simply pressing a
sequence of keys. Starting a computer that has been turned
off is called a cold boot.
You typically interact with the operating system through
the graphical user interface. Most provide a place, called
the desktop, that provides access to computer resources. (See
Figure 4-2.) Some important features common to most operating
systems and application programs include:
Icons—graphic representations for a program, type of file,
or function.
reset page 240
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Pointer—controlled by a mouse, trackpad, or touch screen,
the pointer changes shape depending on its current
function. For example, when shaped like an arrow, the
pointer can be used to select items such as an icon.
Windows—rectangular areas for displaying page 89
information and running programs.
Menus—provide a list of options or commands that can be
selected.
Tabs—divide menus into major activity areas such as format
and page layout.
Dialog boxes—typically provide information or request
input.
Help—provides online assistance for operating system
functions and procedures.
Gesture control—ability to control operations with finger
movements, such as swiping, sliding, and pinching.

Description
Most offices have filing cabinets that store important
documents in folders. Similarly, most operating systems store
data and programs in a system of files and folders. Files are
used to store data and programs. Related files are stored
within a folder, and, for organizational purposes, a folder
can contain other folders, or subfolders. For example, you
might organize your electronic files in the Documents folder
on your hard disk. This folder could contain other folders,
each named to indicate its contents. One might be “Computer
Class” and could contain all the files you have created (or
will create) for this course.
Categories
While there are hundreds of different operating systems,
there are only three basic categories: embedded, stand-alone,
and network.
Embedded operating systems are used in cell phones and
tablets, as well as video game systems and thousands of
other small electronic devices. Also known as real-time
operating systems (RTOS), these operating systems are
uniquely designed to work exclusively with (i.e., embedded
into) a particular device’s hardware. Typically designed
for a specific application, embedded operating systems are
essential in the evolution of IoT where many everyday
devices are able to communicate with one another, as
discussed in Chapter 1. For example, Watch OS was developed
by Apple exclusively for the Apple Watch. (See Figure 4-3.)
Stand-alone operating systems are used in a single desktop
or laptop computer. (See Figure 4-4.) Also called desktop
operating systems, these operating systems are located on
reset page 242
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the computer’s hard disk. Often desktop computers and
laptops are part of a network. In these cases, the desktop
operating system works with the network to share and
coordinate resources. Two of the most popular stand-alone
operating systems are Apple’s macOS and Microsoft’s
Windows.
Network operating systems (NOS) are used to control and
coordinate computers that are networked or linked together.
These networks can range in size, from a few computers in
an office to large networks that spans an entire company or
university. An NOS can be composed of several smaller
networks and many types of computers.
Network operating systems are typically located on one
of the connected computers’ hard disks. Called the network
server, this computer coordinates all communication between
the other computers. Popular network operating systems
include Linux, Windows Server, and UNIX.

The operating system is often referred to as the software
environment or software platform. A computer’s platform
dictates what applications will run on that page 90
device. Almost all application programs are
designed to run with a specific platform. For example,
Apple’s iMovie software is designed to run with the macOS
environment and will not run on an Android cell phone or
Windows laptop. Many applications, however, have different
versions, each designed to operate with a particular
platform. For example, there are two versions of Microsoft
Office, one designed to work with Windows and another
designed to work with macOS.

Mobile Operating Systems
Mobile operating systems, also known as mobile OS, are a
type of embedded operating system. Just like other computer
systems, mobile computers—including cell phones, tablets,
and wearable computers—require an operating system. These
mobile operating systems are less complicated and more
specialized for wireless communication.
While there are numerous mobile operating systems, two of
the best known are Android and iOS.
Android was developed by Google and is used as the platform
for many popular cell phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S1
Ultra and the Google Pixel 4a.
iOS was developed by Apple and is used as the platform for
Apple’s mobile devices, the iPad and iPhone. (See Figure

operating system. Before downloading an app, be sure that it
is designed to run with the mobile operating system on your

Desktop Operating Systems
Every personal computer has an operating system controlling
its operations. The most widely used desktop operating
systems are Windows, macOS, UNIX, and Linux.
Windows
Microsoft’s Windows is the most widely used personal
computer operating system. Because its market share is so
large, more application programs have been developed to run
under Windows than any other operating system. Windows comes
in a variety of different versions and is designed to run
with a variety of different microprocessors.
The most recent version of Windows, Windows 11, was
announced in 2021. (See Figure 4-6.) Windows 11 is
Microsoft’s desktop, laptop, and tablet operating system.
This version of Windows includes several innovations, such as
a simplified user interface and improved support for mobile
devices, such as tablets and 2-in-1 laptops. One of the
biggest changes with Windows 11 is its ability to run Android
apps on a Windows device.

Most cell phone operating systems include a virtual assistant, like
Apple’s Siri or Google Assistant, that scans your personal information
such as calendar events, e-mails, text messages, and GPS location to
anticipate your needs and help organize your life. However, most users
of these complex programs are unaware that they copy and transfer data
from texts, e-mails, and GPS back to company servers. Should your
operating system be gathering and sharing this data? Who should be in
charge of what data is gathered and how it is stored?
macOS
Apple has been the leader in the development of powerful and
easy-to-use personal computer operating systems since its
introduction of the Macintosh personal computer in 1984.
Designed to run only with Apple computers, macOS is not as
widely used as the Windows operating system. As a result,
fewer application programs have been written for it. However,
with increasing sales of Apple computers, the use of macOS
has been rapidly increasing and is widely recognized as one
of the most innovative operating systems. The popular iOS and
iPadOS mobile operating systems are based off the macOS.
macOS is the most widely used Mac desktop operating
system. macOS 12 Monterey, announced in 2021, includes the
ability to control multiple devices from one keyboard and
mouse, improved videoconferencing tools, and ways to
customize notifications to reduce distractions when working.
(See Figure 4-7.)

UNIX and Linux
The UNIX operating system was originally designed in the late
1960s to run on minicomputers in network environments. Over
the years, UNIX has evolved with numerous different versions.
Now, it is widely used by servers on the web, mainframe
computers, and very powerful personal computers. There are a
large number of different versions of UNIX.
Linux is an operating system that extended one of the UNIX
versions. It was originally developed by a graduate student
at the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds, in 1991. He
allowed free distribution of the operating system code and
encouraged others to modify and further develop the code.
Programs released in this way are called open source. Linux
is a popular and powerful alternative to the Windows
operating system. (See Figure 4-8.) Linux has been the basis
of several other operating systems. For example, Google’s
Chrome OS and the Android mobile operating system are based
on Linux.
reset page 249
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 4-8 Linux
Linux
Chrome OS integrates with web servers to run applications
and to perform other traditional operating system functions.
This capability has made Chrome OS a popular choice for
inexpensive notebook computers that use cloud computing and
cloud storage to do things that would normally require much
more expensive hardware. One limitation of these computers is
that their efficiency is dependent upon the speed of their
Internet connection.
Virtualization
As we have discussed, application programs are designed to
run with particular operating systems. What if you wanted to
run two or more applications, each requiring a different
operating system? One solution would be to install each of
the operating systems on a different computer. There is,
however, a way in which a single physical computer can
support multiple operating systems that operate
independently. This approach is called virtualization.
reset page 250
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
When a single physical computer runs a special program
known as virtualization software, it operates as though it
were two or more separate and independent computers, known as
virtual machines. Each virtual machine appears to the user as
a separate, independent computer with its own operating
system. The operating system of the physical machine is known
as the host operating system. The operating system for each
virtual machine is known as the guest operating system.
Users can readily switch between virtual computers and
programs running on them. There are several programs that
create and run virtual machines. Two such programs, Parallels
and VMware, allow a user on a Mac to run Windows programs in
macOS. (See Figure 4-9.)

Utilities
Ideally, personal computers would continuously run without
problems. However, that simply is not the case. All kinds of
things can happen such as files or apps can go missing,
storage space can fill up, and data can be lost. These events
can make computing very frustrating. That’s where utilities
come in. Utilities are specialized programs designed to make
computing easier. There are hundreds of different utility
programs. The most essential are
Search programs provide a quick and easy way to search or
examine an entire computer system to help you find specific
applications, data, or other files.
Storage management programs help solve the problem of
running out of storage space by providing lists of
application programs, stored videos, and other program
files so that you can eliminate unused applications or
archive large files elsewhere.
Backup programs make copies of files to be used in case the
originals are lost or damaged. Windows 11 comes with a free
backup program, the File History tool, and macOS has a
backup feature named Time Machine.
Antivirus programs guard your computer system against
viruses or other damaging programs that can invade your
computer system. Popular antivirus programs include Norton
AntiVirus and Bitdefender’s Antivirus Plus.

Troubleshooting or diagnostic programs recognize and
correct problems, ideally before they become serious.
Virtual assistants are utilities that accept commands
through text or speech to allow intuitive interaction with
your computer, cell phone, or tablet and coordinate
personal data across multiple applications. Microsoft
Windows 11 has the virtual assistant Cortana, and Apple’s
macOS has Siri. To learn more about virtual assistants, see
the Making IT Work for You: Virtual Assistant on pages 94
and 95.
Most operating systems provide some utility programs. Even
more powerful utility programs can be purchased separately or
in utility suites.
page 94
Making IT work for you
VIRTUAL ASSISTANT
Your cell phone already organizes much of your life. It
contains a list of your contacts, alarms and timers you
can set, and a calendar of upcoming events. However,
coordinating all these details can be challenging. Virtual
assistants can help you manage your day, review e-mails
and texts, and even suggest local restaurants.
What Is a Virtual Assistant? As defined earlier, a virtual assistant
is a utility that coordinates personal data across several applications
and provides a more intuitive way to interact with your computer, phone,
or tablet. Most operating systems offer a virtual assistant; Apple offers
reset page 253
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Siri, Microsoft has Cortana, Amazon has Alexa, and Google has Google
Assistant. The most common way to interact with these utilities is
through voice commands.
Google Assistant lets a user dictate a text message. Most intelligent
assistants will coordinate with your phone’s features to send texts and
e-mails, or make calls.
Google Inc.
Voice Assist One of the most important features of your virtual
assistant is its ability to listen to spoken commands and respond
verbally. This allows you to text, review e-mails, and even schedule
events while keeping your hands free.
Apple’s Siri accepts a voice command to make a phone call. Intelligent
assistants interpret voice commands and can perform simple actions, such
reset page 254
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
as setting alarms, sending e-mails or text messages, and alerting you to
upcoming calendar events.
Apple Inc.
Initially, you must get your assistant’s attention with a key phrase,
such as Hey Siri, OK Google, or Hey Cortana, depending on your device.
After you alert your virtual assistant that you want help, you can ask it
to manage your personal information or look up information on the
Internet. Some common requests are:
“What is the weather like today?”
“Do I have any new e-mails?”
“Add milk to the grocery list.”
“Text Mom that I am going to be late.”
page 95
Making Plans Many virtual assistants review your e-mail and text
messages for key words that indicate a calendar event. Virtual assistants
scan texts and e-mails for indications of calendar events, such as a text
that reads “Dinner tomorrow at 8 pm?” or an e-mail receipt for airline
tickets.
Your virtual assistant then uses that information to add events to your
calendar, such as “Dinner” at 8:00 pm tomorrow or “flight” with
duration and departure and landing times—even correcting for time zone
changes and including a link in the calendar event to quickly retrieve
the original e-mail.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Microsoft Cortana monitors Windows apps for text that looks like calendar
events. Most intelligent assistants can monitor texts and e-mails for
potential calendar events.
Microsoft Corporation
Connecting Different Data Points Virtual assistants can use
multiple pieces of information to make suggestions to your schedule. For
example, your virtual assistant uses your phone’s GPS, traffic
information on the Internet, and the details on your calendar to remind
you when you need to leave for your next appointment if you want to
arrive there on time.
Security, Settings, and Limitations Although many of these features
are set up by default, you may have to change the security and setting of
your device to allow your virtual assistant access to your e-mails, text
messages, photos, microphone, and GPS location.
Amazon’s Alexa integrates with home automation tools. You can change the
control your personal assistant has—from the ability to read your e-
mails and dim the house lights to simply alerting you to calendar events.
Google, INC.
You may also find that the applications you use do not work well with
your Assistant. For example, Siri only schedules events on the iOS
calendar app, and Google Assistant will only search your e-mails for
calendar events if you are using Google’s email service, Gmail. As a
general rule, assistants only work well with the apps from the same
developer—Siri works with Apple tools, Cortana works with Microsoft
software, and Google Assistant works with Google applications.

Operating System Utilities
Most operating systems are accompanied by several common
utility programs, including a search program, a storage
management program, and a backup program.
Search Most cell phones have hundreds of apps and thousands
of pictures and files. How can you find a particular app or
file you need among all the others? Search programs can
search your device for you to separate what you need from all
the other apps and files. You will find a search program on
mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, as well as
laptops and desktops running Windows and macOS. (See Figure
4-10.)

Storage Management As you use your computer, your hard disk
will fill with photos, videos, documents, and applications.
You may find that as you run out of hard drive space, your
computer slows down. Most operating systems include utilities
to organize and view your hard drive usage to identify old or
unused files. Using these tools, you can move or eliminate
files and give your operating system the space it needs to
run at peak efficiency.

Storage management programs can identify and remove
unused files and applications. You will find a storage

Backup It can be devastating to drop a cell phone or have a
laptop stolen. Not only is the device itself expensive to
replace, but the files and photos on the device may be lost
forever. Backup programs should be run frequently to avoid
the unexpected loss of files from your devices. All major
operating systems offer backup utilities to save a copy of
your device’s data. (See Figure 4-12.)

Utility Suites
Like application software suites, utility suites combine
several programs into one package. Buying the package is less
expensive than buying the programs separately. Some of the
best-known utility suites are by Bitdefender and Norton. (See
Figure 4-13.) These suites provide a variety of utilities.
Some programs will improve your computer’s performance,
while other programs will protect your system from dangerous
computer viruses. You can “catch” a computer virus many
ways, including by opening attachments to e-mail messages and
downloading software from the Internet. (We will discuss
computer viruses in detail in Chapter 9.)

Computer support specialists provide technical support to
customers and other users. They also may be called
technical support specialists or help-desk technicians.
Computer support specialists manage the everyday technical
problems faced by computer users. They resolve common
networking problems and may use troubleshooting programs to
diagnose problems. Most computer support specialists are
hired to work within a company and provide technical
support for other employees and divisions. However, it is
reset page 262
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
increasingly common for companies to contract with
businesses that specialize in offering technical support.
Employers generally look for individuals with either an
advanced associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree to
fill computer support specialist positions. Degrees in
information technology or information systems may be
preferred. However, because demand for qualified applicants
is so high, those with practical experience and
certification from a training program increasingly fill
these positions. Employers seek individuals with customer
service experience who demonstrate good analytical,
communication, and people skills.
Computer support specialists can expect to earn an
annual salary of $43,040 to $68,060. Opportunities for
advancement are very good and may involve design and
implementation of new systems.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Making Better Computers by Making Them More Human
Imagine that the next time your computer breaks, instead of getting it
fixed, it heals itself. Many of our greatest technological breakthroughs
are replicating the amazing complexity of nature. Scientists are
continuing to look to nature to bring about the next wave of computing
innovations. These include holding information in the way a brain holds
information, with synapses and nerves to think, remember, and process. In

eliminate them before they can become a problem. In the future, computers
may not only fix viruses and other software issues, but also identify and
resolve hardware problems using autonomic computing.

Autonomic computing is a computing model that allows machines to run
with little human intervention. It has the potential to revolutionize the
way we interact with computers. The Cloud and Autonomic Computer Center is
the leading research group devoted to developing self-healing computers.
This center includes the National Science Foundation, leading universities
(such as the University of Arizona and Texas Tech University), and
industry leaders (such as Mitsubishi and Dell). Their objective is to free
businesses and individuals from time-consuming computer maintenance by
developing systems that are self-maintaining and virtually invisible to
the user.
Autonomic processes in machines are modeled after human autonomic
processes. For example, each of us has an autonomic system that
automatically controls our breathing, our heart rate, and many other
bodily functions. Scientists hope autonomic computing will behave in a
similar manner and maintain computer systems without human intervention.
Such computers would not have self-awareness but would be self-correcting.
These autonomic computing systems, however, are not artificial
intelligence systems. Although autonomic systems automatically perform
standard operations, they do not have human cognitive abilities or
intelligence. These systems are limited to reacting to their own systems
and have limited capability to learn from experience to correct errors. In
order to adapt to conditions beyond this, scientists have turned to
artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence can be found in computers around the world,
from tiny cell phones to towering mainframes. These programs mimic the
human brain. Researchers at MIT are working on neuromorphic computer
chips. A neuromorphic chip is a computer chip that computes using an
architecture like a brain, with neurons and synapses. They intend to use
resistive computing, a process that uses analog voltages to store and
compute data, instead of the digital method used today that is limited to
binary values. This allows the chip to handle artificial intelligence
tasks much more efficiently than today’s hardware.
Given the potential for a self-maintaining server and a human-like
computer chip, the possibility of a similar system designed for a personal
computer seems less like a dream and more like a reality. What do you
think? Will personal computers ever think and care for themselves?

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
System software works with end users, application
programs, and computer hardware to handle many details
relating to computer operations.
Not a single program but a collection or system of
programs, these programs handle hundreds of technical
details with little or no user intervention.
Four kinds of systems programs are operating systems,
utilities, device drivers, and language translators.
Operating systems coordinate resources, provide an
interface between users and the computer, and run
programs.
Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing
computer resources.
Device drivers allow particular input or output
devices to communicate with the rest of the computer
system.
Language translators convert programming instructions
written by programmers into a language that computers
can understand and process.

Operating systems (software environments, software
platforms) handle technical details.
Functions
Functions include managing resources, providing a user
interface (graphical user interface, or GUI, provides
visual interface; voice assist tools accept spoken
commands), and running applications. Multitasking allows
switching between different applications stored in
memory; current programs run in the foreground; other
programs run in the background.
Features
Booting starts (cold) or restarts (warm) a computer
system. The desktop provides access to computer
resources. Common features include icons, pointers,
windows, menus, tabs, dialog boxes, help, and gesture
control. Data and programs are stored in a system of
files and folders.
Categories
Three categories of operating systems are

Embedded—also known as real-time operating systems
(RTOS); used with handheld computers; operating system
stored within the device.
Stand-alone (desktop)—controls a single computer;
located on the hard disk.
Network (NOS)—controls and coordinates networked
computers; located on the network server.
Operating systems are often called software
environments or software platforms.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to understand the functionality of system software,
including operating systems and utility programs.
MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEMS

Mobile operating systems (mobile OS) are embedded in
every cell phone and tablet. These systems are less
complicated and more specialized for wireless
communication than desktop operating systems.
Some of the best known are Google’s Android and
Apple’s iOS.
Android was developed by Google and is based on the
Linux operating system. It is used as the operating
system for some of the most popular cell phone lines,
including the Samsung Galaxy S1 Ultra and Google Pixel
4a.
iOS was developed by Apple and is based on macOS. It is
used as the platform for Apple’s mobile devices, the
iPad and iPhone.
Not all mobile applications will run on all cell
phones. That is because an app is designed to run on a
particular software platform or operating system. Before
downloading an app, be sure that it is designed to run
with the mobile operating system on your mobile device.

ability to run mobile Android apps; improved innovations
for mobile computing; and integration of instant
messaging, videoconferencing, and collaborative work
tools.
macOS
macOS, an innovative, powerful, easy-to-use operating
system, runs on Macintosh computers. macOS 12 Monterey
was introduced in 2021 and includes improved
videoconferencing, notification customization, and the
ability to use one mouse and keyboard across multiple
devices.

UNIX and Linux
UNIX was originally designed to run on minicomputers in
network environments. Now, it is widely used by servers
on the web, mainframe computers, and very powerful
personal computers. There are many different versions of
UNIX. One version, Linux, a popular and powerful
alternative to the Windows operating system, is open-
source software. Google’s Chrome OS is based on Linux.
It integrates with web servers to run applications and to
perform other traditional operating system functions.
Chrome OS is a popular choice for inexpensive notebook
computers using cloud computing and cloud storage. One
limitation of these computers is that their efficiency is
dependent upon the speed of their Internet connection.
Virtualization
Virtualization allows a single physical computer to
support multiple operating systems. Virtualization
software (Parallels and VMware) allows the single
physical computer to operate as two or more separate and
independent computers known as virtual machines. Host
operating systems run on the physical machine. Guest
operating systems operate on virtual machines. Parallels
creates and runs virtual machines on Apple’s macOS X.

Storage management programs help solve the problem of
running out of storage space by providing lists of
programs file.
Backup programs make copies of files to be used in
case the originals are lost or damaged.
Antivirus programs guard against viruses or other
damaging programs.
Troubleshooting (diagnostic) programs recognize and
correct problems.
Virtual assistants accept commands through text or
speech and coordinate personal data across multiple
applications.
Utility Suites
Utility suites combine several programs into one
package. Computer viruses are dangerous programs.
