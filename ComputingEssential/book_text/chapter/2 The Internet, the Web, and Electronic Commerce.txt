When you use a cell phone to text a friend, watch a video, or make a
purchase, you are using the Internet. But what does it mean to “use the
Internet”? Internet devices, like cell phones, are so common it is easy
to overlook the incredible achievements that make the Internet possible. A
closer look at how the Internet works will give you a new appreciation for
this technical marvel and prepare you to use cell phones and other
Internet devices to their full potential.
The Internet is an interconnected mesh of computers and data lines that
connects millions of people and organizations. It is the foundation of the
digital revolution and allows people around the world to share words,
images, and any digital file almost instantaneously. The web provides an
easy-to-use interface to Internet resources. It has become an everyday
tool for all of us to use.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of
the resources available on the Internet and the web. Additionally, you
need to know how to access these resources, to effectively communicate
electronically, to efficiently locate information, to understand
electronic commerce, and to use web utilities.
The Internet and the Web
The Internet was launched in 1969 when the United States
funded a project that developed a national computer network
called Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET)
and has grown to become the largest network in the world. The
Internet is an immense network that connects together smaller
networks all over the globe. The web, also known as the World
Wide Web or WWW, was introduced in 1991. Prior to the web,
the Internet was all text—no graphics, animations, sound, or
video. The web made it possible to include these elements. It
provided a multimedia interface to resources available on the
Internet.
Today, the web is a collection of machines and people
sharing amazing content, but not long ago it was a far
simpler experience. The web has matured through four
generations, commonly called Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. Each
generation is defined by a new technology that changes the
relationship between content creator and audience.
reset page 106
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Web 1.0 is defined by the use of search engines that
connect everyone to web pages of interest. A search engine
makes it possible for users to search the web for web pages
of interest. These web pages had few creators because they
were difficult to create and required a background in
computers and programming. The web pages had very large
audiences because they were designed to be read by anyone
who searched for them.
Web 2.0 is defined by the use of social media that connect
friends and family to social media posts about each
others’ lives. Social media sites make it possible for
people to share videos, posts, and pictures with each
other. This content is created by many people because
creating social media posts does not require special
technical knowledge. Social media posts have smaller
audiences because they are created to only be of interest
to the friends and family of the user who posts the
content.
Web 3.0 is defined by the innovation of the semantic web.
The semantic web allows programs to identify relationships
between data. For example, a program like Amazon’s Alexa
and Google Assistant can inform a user that a flight they
are planning to take has been delayed (see Figure 2-1).
This is accomplished by identifying the relationship
between a flight scheduled on your calendar and flight
delay information available on the Internet. The content
creator is now a computer program, and the content audience
is a single person—the user.
Web 4.0, called the mobile web, is defined by the page 27
use of mobile tools that provide new sources of
information for programs to provide users with information.
This is an extension of Web 3.0, where programs draw
relationships among data to assist individuals, but now the
information available to these programs includes the
information gathered by mobile devices. For example, your
reset page 107
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
cell phone can provide your current location, or your
smartwatch can report your heart rate. A program like
Apple’s Siri can use your current location, the location
of your next calendar event, and local traffic reports on
the Internet to alert you to leave early for an appointment
because of a traffic jam between your current location and
your next event.
Figure 2-1 Web 3.0 application
Google INC.
Just because a new generation of technology comes along
doesn’t mean that older generations are done evolving. We
continue to see innovations in Web 1.0 and Web 2.0
technologies even as Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies are
still being incorporated into our lives. Web 5.0 is on the
horizon—called the emotional web, this generation may
include programs that anticipate our needs based on our mood
and behaviors. However, this future is not yet realized, and
the specifics of Web 5.0 are still to be determined.
It is easy to get the Internet and the web confused, but
they are not the same thing. The Internet is the physical
network. It is made up of wires, cables, satellites, and
rules for exchanging information between computers connected
to the network. Being connected to this network is often
reset page 108
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
described as being online. The Internet connects millions of
computers and resources throughout the world. The web is a
multimedia interface to the resources available on the
Internet. Every day over a billion users from nearly every
country in the world use the Internet and the web. What are
they doing? The most common uses are the following:
Communicating is by far the most popular Internet activity.
Every time someone receives a text, sends an e-mail, or
shares photos or videos online, they are communicating on
the Internet.
Shopping is one of the fastest-growing Internet
applications. From everyday items, like buying groceries,
to special purchases, like buying a prom dress, the
Internet provides a way to get the latest trends and the
cheapest deals.
Searching for information has never been more convenient.
You can access some of the world’s largest libraries
directly from your home computer.
Education or e-learning is another rapidly evolving web
application. You can take driving school classes on your
cell phone or earn college credit from your laptop. There
are courses for every price range and interest.
Online entertainment options are nearly endless. You can
find the latest movies and news, listen your favorite
songs, and play video games with friends around the world.

Work for You: Online Entertainment on pages 28–30.
ethics
Twitter and other social media organizations ban users who post hateful
or violent content. Some people feel that Twitter has an ethical
responsibility to monitor and remove offensive or inaccurate content.
Others say that censorship is a violation of an individual’s right to
reset page 109
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
free speech and that Twitter should never censor content. What do you
think? Who should decide what information is shared on Twitter: the
company or the users?
The first step to using the Internet and the web is to get
connected, or to gain access to the Internet.

Online Video—The Internet offers dozens of ways to view movies and
TV on your Internet-connected devices. Here are four things to
consider:
Is the service free or does it require a monthly subscription? Many
big-name services charge a monthly fee, but there are also plenty of
services that are free with ads.
Does the service include ads? Some services include ads even if you
pay a monthly subscription fee.
What movies and shows are available? Each service has its own
collection of available videos. Before subscribing, make sure you
like what they have to offer.
Will the service work on your devices? Not every service works on
every device. Make sure your devices are supported.
Paid subscription services, like Netflix, offer popular film and TV
shows, as well as original content.
HBO
Some services are best known for their libraries of movies, full seasons
of older TV shows, and original movies and shows exclusively available on
their service. Services such as these include
Amazon Prime (amazon.com/prime).
Netflix (netflix.com).
HBO Max (hbomax.com).
Some services offer a more TV-like experience, offering live TV channel
content, including local news, national news, and sports coverage. Some
of the most popular services that include live TV channels are
Hulu (hulu.com).
YouTube TV (tv.youtube.com).

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Online Music—You can access large music libraries online, with
everything from contemporary hits to classical music. The things to
consider when selecting an online music source are similar to choosing
an online movie and TV service:
Is the service free, or does it require a monthly fee?
Does the service include ads?
What musicians and albums are available on the service?
Does the service work with your devices?
page 29
Popular online music services include
Spotify (spotify.com).
YouTube music (music.youtube.com).
Tidal (tidal.com).
Online Books—Digital books allow you to download and read books on
your cell phone, tablet, or laptop. Two of the most popular digital
book sellers are Amazon’s Kindle Store (amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks) and
Barnes and Noble’s Nook Store (barnesandnoble.com).
Digital books allow you to read several books at a time on different
digital devices without having to carry around tons of books.
Aspiro AB
Before purchasing a book, consider checking out your local library’s
digital book collection. Most libraries offer digital books, magazines,
and audio books you can borrow without ever having to set foot in the
library. There are also services that give you access to reading material

for a monthly fee. Scribd (scribd.com) offers access to its collection of
books, magazines, and audiobooks for a monthly fee, and audible
(audible.com) specializes in audiobooks.
Popular social media site Instagram updates your Instagram account with
new postings from users around the world.
Instagram Inc.
Social Media—Social media websites offer a way to connect and
interact with others about news, movies, and everyday life. Thoughts
and ideas are posted instantly with sites like Twitter, a popular
platform for sharing short messages, videos, and photos. You can
follow other Twitter users to get automatic updates on the posts
they make, and others can follow you to keep up to date on your
posts.Things
to consider when choosing a social media app:
Does the social media app work on your devices? Not all social
media apps are available on all devices. For example, many social
media apps only work on cell phones.
Do your friends and family already belong to a social media site?
While social media is a great way to meet new people, it is also a
great way to keep up with friends and family. If you already know
people who use a social media app, they could be a good way to try
out social media.
reset page 113
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
What types of interactions does the social media app page 30
support? Different social media sites support different
types of interactions. For example, TikTok specializes in short
videos, and Instagram encourages sharing photos. Choose an app
that caters to what you are interested in sharing.
News feed services, like feedly.com, allow you to search for news sources
by publisher or topic, creating a more “newspaper”-like reading
experience.
Apple Inc.
Popular social media sites include
Twitter (twitter.com).
Facebook (facebook.com).
Instagram (instagram.com).
TikTok (tiktok.com).
News Feeds—Social media services such as Facebook or Twitter are a
good way to share and explore news, but they don’t offer an
experience similar to a newspaper. For a more traditional view of the
day’s events, consider a news feed service. A news feed application
takes articles from news organizations, collects them according to
your interest, and presents them like a newspaper—grouped by topic
and in chronological order
Popular news feed services include

Podcasts—Podcasts are serialized audio programs available to listen
to on demand. These programs can be nonfiction, such as news stories,
lectures, topical discussions, and interviews, or they can be fiction,
such as science fiction, drama, or suspense stories. You can use a
podcast app to subscribe to a podcast and share podcasts with friends,
receive alerts when a new podcast is available, and rate and comment
on podcasts.
Popular podcast apps include
Google Podcasts (podcasts.google.com).
Apple Podcasts (apple.com/apple-podcasts).
Spotify (spotify.com).

Internet Access
Your computer is a very powerful tool. However, it needs to
be connected to the Internet to truly unleash its power. Once
on the Internet, your computer becomes an extension of what
seems like a giant computer—a computer that branches all
over the world. When provided with a connection to the
Internet, you can use a browser program to search the web.
Providers
The most common way to access the Internet is through an
Internet service provider (ISP). The providers are already
connected to the Internet and provide a path or connection
for individuals to access the Internet.
The most widely used commercial Internet service providers
use telephone lines, cable, and/or wireless connections. Some
of the best-known providers in the United States are AT&T,
Comcast, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon.

As we will discuss in Chapter 8, users connect to ISPs
using one of a variety of connection technologies including
digital subscriber line (DSL), cable, and wireless modems.
tips
Are you getting the most out of your web browser? Here are a
few suggestions to make you faster and more efficient.
1
Bookmarks/Favorites Bar: Most browsers have a bookmarks or
favorites bar just below the address bar. Add your top 5 or 10
most-often-visited websites here. The next time you want to visit
one of these sites, select it from the bookmarks/favorites list
rather than entering the site’s URL.
2
Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts are often faster than using a mouse.
Use the following: F5 (refresh); Alt + left arrow (back); Ctrl + T
(new tab); Ctrl + W (close tab); Ctrl + Enter (adds “www” and
“.com” to any domain name you type in the address bar).
3
Extensions/Add-Ons: Many browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox,
allow users to install small, third-party programs that extend, or
add to, the capabilities of the browser. These programs can
perform a variety of tasks, from providing easy access to your
cloud services to making it easier to capture information on a web
page.
4
Configure Settings: All browsers have a settings or options page
that provides ways to secure and customize your Internet browsing.
For example, you can deny websites from automatically opening up
another browser window, called pop-ups (these annoying windows
often contain advertisements). You can also set up your browser to
always open the same websites on starting up your browser.
Browsers
Today it is common to access the Internet from a variety of
devices like cell phones, tablets, and laptops. These devices
use programs called browsers to provide access to web
resources. These programs connect you to remote computers;
open and transfer files; display text, images, and
reset page 116
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
multimedia; and provide in one tool an uncomplicated
interface to the Internet and web documents. Four well-known
browsers are Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and
Mozilla Firefox. (See Figure 2-2.)
Figure 2-2 Browser
Piotr Swat/Alamy Stock Photo
Browsers differ not only by designer, but also by what
device they work on. For example, Chrome is a web browser
designed by Google that has a mobile version for page 32
cell phones and tablets and a desktop version for
laptops and desktops. Mobile browsers are designed for the
smaller touchscreens of mobile devices. They typically have
larger buttons to select options and provide multitouch
support for actions such as “pinch” or “stretch” to zoom
in on web content. (See Figure 2-3.) Desktop browsers are
designed for laptop and desktop computers, with smaller
buttons and more on-screen options designed to take advantage
of larger monitors and the precision of mouse input.

For browsers to connect to resources, the location or
address of the resources must be specified. These addresses
are called uniform resource locators (URLs). All URLs have
at least two basic parts.
The first part presents the protocol used to connect to the
resource. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, protocols are
rules for exchanging data between computers. The protocol
https is used for web traffic and is one of the most widely
used Internet protocols.
The second part presents the domain name. It indicates the
specific address where the resource is located. In Figure
2-4 the domain is identified as www.mtv.com. The last part
of the domain name following the dot (.) is the top-level
domain (TLD). Also known as the web suffix, it typically
identifies the type of organization. For example, .com
indicates a commercial site. (See Figure 2-5.)

Figure 2-5 Traditional top-level domains
Once the browser has connected to the website, a document
file is sent back to your computer. This document typically
contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a markup language
for displaying web pages. The browser interprets the HTML
formatting instructions and displays the document as a web
page. For example, when your browser first connects to the
Internet, it opens up to a web page specified in the browser
settings. Web pages present information about the site along
with references and hyperlinks or links that connect to other
documents containing related information—text files, graphic
images, audio, and video clips.
Various technologies are used to provide highly
interactive and animated websites. These technologies include
the following:
JavaScript is a language often used within HTML documents
to trigger interactive features, such as opening new
browser windows and checking information entered in online
forms. The Microsoft search engine Bing.com uses JavaScript
to make its website more interactive and to assist its
users by auto-filling search requests as they type content
into the search box.
PHP, like JavaScript, is a language often used within HTML
documents to improve a website’s interactivity. Unlike
reset page 119
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
JavaScript, which typically executes on the user’s
computer, PHP executes on the website’s computer.
Cascading style sheets (CSS) are separate files referenced
by, or lines inserted into, an HTML document that control
the appearance of a web page. CSS help ensure that related
web pages have a consistent presentation or look. Netflix
uses CSS to visually connect all its web pages.

Web Utilities
Utilities are programs that make computing easier. Web
utilities are specialized utility programs that make the
Internet and the web easier and safer to use. Some of these
utilities are browser-related programs that either become
part of your browser or are executed from your browser, while
others work as separate stand-alone applications. Common uses
for web utilities include filtering content and transferring
files.
Filters
Filters block access to selected sites. The Internet is an
interesting and multifaceted arena. But not all aspects of
the Internet are appropriate for all audiences. Parents, in
reset page 120
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
particular, are concerned about children roaming unrestricted
across the Internet. Filter programs allow parents as well as
organizations to block out selected sites and set time
limits. (See Figure 2-6.) Additionally, these programs can
monitor use and generate reports detailing the total time
spent on the Internet and the time spent at individual
websites. For a list of some of the best-known filters, see
Figure 2-7.

File Transfer Utilities
Using file transfer utility software, you can copy files to
your computer from specially configured servers. This is
called downloading. You also can use file transfer utility
software to copy files from your computer to another computer
on the Internet. This is called uploading. Three popular
types of file transfer are web-based, BitTorrent, and FTP.
Web-based file transfer services make use of a web browser
to upload and download files. This eliminates the need for
any custom software to be installed. Popular services
include Microsoft’s onedrive (onedrive.com) and Google’s
Google drive (drive.google.com).
BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many different
computers for more efficient downloads, unlike other
transfer technologies whereby a file is copied from one
computer on the Internet to another. A single file might be
located on dozens of individual computers. When you
download the file, each computer sends you a tiny piece of
the larger file, making BitTorrent well suited for page 34
transferring very large files. Unfortunately,
BitTorrent technology often has been used for distributing
unauthorized copies of copyrighted music and video.
File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer
protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files to and
from your computer across the Internet and are frequently
used for uploading changes to a website hosted by an
Internet service provider. FTP has been used for decades
and still remains one of the most popular methods of file
transfer.
Internet Security Suites

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
An Internet security suite is a collection of utility
programs designed to maintain your security and privacy while
you are on the web. These programs control spam, protect
against computer viruses, provide filters, and much more. You
could buy each program separately; however, the cost of the
suite is typically much less. Two of the best-known Internet
security suites are Symantec Norton Internet Security and
Bitdefender Internet Security. These companies also offer
apps for mobile devices: Bitdefender Mobile Security and
Norton Mobile Security. (See Figure 2-8.)

Communication
As previously mentioned, communication is the most popular
Internet activity, and its impact cannot be overestimated. At
a personal level, friends and family can stay in contact with
one another even when separated by thousands of miles. At a
business level, electronic communication has become a
standard way to stay in touch with suppliers, employees, and
customers. Some popular types of Internet communication are
social networking, blogs, microblogs, podcasts, wikis, e-
mail, and messaging.
community
Every community has etiquette rules. On the Internet, these rules are
called “netiquette,” a combination of Internet and etiquette. When
reset page 124
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
you enter a new community—online or in real life—it can be difficult
to learn the etiquette rules. Fortunately, many social media sites have
guidelines for new users to help them navigate the netiquette of social
media. For example, did you know it was bad manners to type in all
capital letters? It can make readers feel that you are screaming at
them! Before communicating online, make sure you understand the
netiquette of that community.
Social Networking
Social networking is one of the fastest-growing and most
significant Web 2.0 applications. Social networking sites
focus on connecting people and organizations that share a
common interest or activity. These sites typically provide a
wide array of tools that facilitate meeting, communicating,
and sharing. There are hundreds of social networking sites,
but they share some common features:
Profiles or pages allow you to share information about
yourself or your business. Individuals create profiles
while businesses create pages. Profiles and pages often
include a photo that will be displayed along with the
member name when they submit a post or send a message.
Individuals typically use a photo of their face, while
businesses often use a business logo. Other details that
your profile or page might include are contact information
and a short biography describing yourself or your business.
Groups and friends are the other members on social media
that you will communicate with. Friends are individuals you
communicate with, while groups are communities of other
members that share information and discuss specific topics.
Groups often organize around a topic, event, or idea.
News feed is the first page you see after logging into a
social networking site. It typically consists of a
collection of recent posts from friends, trending topics on
the site, people’s responses to your posts, and
advertisements.
reset page 125
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Share settings on your social media account determine who
can see your posts. The most common options include sharing
with everyone, just your friends, or just a subset of your
friends.
Figure 2-10 Facebook profile

privacy
Have you ever seen one of those funny or not-so-funny embarrassing
personal videos on the Internet? Unless you are careful, you could be
starring in one of those videos. Without privacy settings, images and
videos posted to these sites can be viewed and potentially reposted for
all to see. If a social networking friend were to post an embarrassing
video, would all your friends be able to see it? What about parents,
teachers, or potential employers?

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
A social network often has an overall focus. For example,
LinkedIn is a popular business-oriented social networking
site. The profiles on LinkedIn share professional
information, like resumes and job successes, and the
corporate pages concentrate on sharing their corporate
culture and promoting job openings. By contrast, the largest
social networking site, Facebook, originally had a focus of
connecting friends and family, but it has expanded to include
news sites, entertainment sites, and a powerful way for
businesses and organizations to connect with their audience.
While Facebook is the largest social network, there are
many social networking sites, each with its own unique
features and interactions. For example, TikTok is a social
networking site that concentrates on sharing short videos,
and Instagram puts an emphasis on sharing photos. For a list
of some of the most popular sites, see Figure 2-11.

security; however, they are often more complex to set up and
maintain.
Many individuals create personal websites, called blogs,
to keep in touch with friends and family. Blog postings are
time-stamped and arranged with the newest item first. Often,
readers of these sites are allowed to comment. Some blogs are
like online diaries with personal information; others focus
on information about a hobby or theme, such as knitting,
electronic devices, or good books. Although most are written
by individual bloggers, there are also group blogs with
multiple contributors. Some businesses and newspapers also
have started blogging as a quick publishing method. Several
sites provide tools to create blogs. Two of the most widely
used are Blogger and WordPress.
Much like a blog, a microblog allows an individual or
company to share posts with an audience. However, microblogs
are designed to be used with mobile devices and limit the
size of posts. For example, Twitter, one of the most popular
microblogging sites, limits posts, also known as tweets, to
280 characters. (See Figure 2-12.) Instagram, another popular
microblogging site, is designed to share images and videos

Microblogging has become a significant media tool, used by
politicians and celebrities to share moment-to-moment
thoughts with their audience. For example, Taylor Swift has
over 83 million followers on Twitter.
Podcasts are audio programs delivered over the Internet.
Typically, a podcast is one audio program in a series of
related podcasts. For example, The Science of Happiness
podcast offers a series of episodes presenting tips for a
happier life. (See Figure 2-13.) Podcasts vary page 37
widely, from daily news to arts and comedy shows.

A wiki is a website specially designed to allow visitors
to use their browser to add, edit, or delete the site’s
content. “Wiki” comes from the Hawaiian word for fast,
which describes the simplicity of editing and publishing
through wiki software. Wikis support collaborative writing in
which there isn’t a single expert author, but rather a
community of interested people that builds knowledge over
time. Perhaps the most famous example is Wikipedia, an online
encyclopedia, written and edited by anyone who wants to
contribute, that has millions of entries in over 20
languages.
Creating blogs and wikis are examples of web authoring. We
will discuss web authoring software in detail in Chapter 3.

Our real life and our digital lives compete for our attention—
sometimes with deadly results. In 2020, over 1.6 million car collisions
were attributed to texting while driving. Engineers, programmers, and
government officials are working hard to find innovative solutions to
reduce these preventable tragedies. Does your cell phone have a
“driving mode” or apps to help keep drivers focused on the road? What
are the laws in your area regarding texting and driving?
Messaging
Electronic messaging is a popular way to communicate quickly
and efficiently with friends, family, and co-workers. This
form of communication is particularly common on cell phones,
where messages are short and informal, and instantaneous
responses are the standard. The two most widely used forms of
electronic messaging are text and instant messaging.
Text messaging, also known as texting or SMS (short
message service), is the process of sending a short
electronic message, typically fewer than 160 characters,
using a wireless network to another person, who views the
message on a mobile device such as a cell phone. Today,
billions of people send text messages every day. It has
become one of the most widely used ways to send very short
messages from one individual to another. Text messaging was
originally limited to characters, but you can now send
images, video, and sound using a variation of SMS known as
reset page 131
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
MMS (multimedia messaging service). Although popular and
convenient, there are downsides to using this technology in
the wrong context. A great deal of attention has been
directed toward texting while driving. A study by Car and
Driver concluded that texting while driving had a greater
negative impact on driver safety than being drunk. Several
states have passed laws prohibiting texting while driving.
Instant messaging (IM) allows two or more people to
contact each other via direct, live communication. (See
Figure 2-15.) To use instant messaging, you page 38
register with an instant messaging service and then
specify a list of friends. Whenever you connect to the
Internet, your IM service is notified. It then notifies
your friends who are available to chat and notifies your
friends who are online that you are available. You can then
send messages directly back and forth. Most instant
messaging programs also include videoconferencing features,
file sharing, and remote assistance. Many businesses
routinely use these instant messaging features. Three of
the most popular instant messaging services are Facebook
Messenger, WhatsApp, and Google Meet.

E-mail

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Unlike electronic messaging, e-mail or electronic mail is
used to communicate longer and more formal text. E-mail
exchanges tend to take longer to write and are more carefully
crafted than text message exchanges, which make them ideal
for business communications and newsletters. A typical e-mail
message has four basic elements: header, message, signature,
and attachment. (See Figure 2-16.) The header appears first
and typically includes the following information:
Addresses: E-mail messages typically display the addresses
of the intended recipient of the e-mail, anyone else who is
to receive a copy of the e-mail, and the sender of the e-
mail. The e-mail message in Figure 2-16 is to
dcoats@usc.edu, copied to aboyd@sdu.edu, and sent from
cwillis@nyu.edu. E-mail addresses have two basic parts.
(See Figure 2-17.) The first part is the user’s name and
the second part is the domain name, which includes the top-
level domain. In our example e-mail, dcoats is the
recipient’s user name. The server providing e-mail service
for the recipient is usc.edu. The top-level domain
indicates that the provider is an educational institution.
Subject: A one-line description, used to present the topic
of the message. Subject lines typically are displayed when
a person checks his or her mailbox.

communications, the signature is automatically inserted into
the bottom of an e-mail and can be customized to include the
sender’s company name, address, and telephone number. Many

e-mail programs allow you to include files such as documents
and images as attachments. If a message has an attachment,
the file name typically appears at the end of the e-mail.
(See Figure 2-16.)
There are two basic types of e-mail systems: client-based
and web-based.
Client-based e-mail systems require a special program
known as an e-mail client to be installed on your computer.
Before you can begin e-mailing, you need to run the e-mail
client from your computer, which communicates with the e-
mail service provider. Two of the most widely used e-mail
clients are Apple’s Mail and Microsoft’s Outlook.
Web-based e-mail systems do not require an e-mail program
to be installed on your computer. Once your computer’s
browser connects to an e-mail service provider, a special
program called a webmail client is run on the e-mail
provider’s computer and then you can begin e-mailing. This
is known as webmail. Most Internet service providers offer
webmail services. Three free webmail service providers are
Google’s Gmail, Microsoft’s Outlook, and Yahoo!’s Yahoo!
Mail.
For individual use, webmail is more widely used because it
frees the user from installing and maintaining an e-mail
client on every computer used to access e-mail. With webmail,
you can access your e-mail from any computer anywhere that
has Internet access.
E-mail can be a valuable asset in your personal and
professional life. However, like many other valuable
technologies, there are drawbacks too. Americans receive
billions of unwanted and unsolicited e-mails every year. This
unwelcome mail is called spam. Although spam is indeed a
distraction and nuisance, it also can be dangerous. For
example, computer viruses or destructive programs are often
reset page 135

attached to unsolicited e-mail. Computer viruses will be
discussed in Chapter 4.
tips
Are you tired of sorting through an inbox full of spam? Here
are a few spam-reducing suggestions:
1
Keep a low profile. Many spammers collect e-mail addresses from
personal web pages, social networking sites, and message boards.
Be cautious when posting your address.
2
Use caution when giving out your address. Many companies
collect and sell e-mail addresses to spammers. Be sure to read the
privacy policy of a site before providing your address.
3
Don’t ever respond to spam. Many are a trick to validate active
e-mail addresses. These addresses are worth more to spammers, who
then sell the addresses to other spammers.
4
Use antispam and filter options. Most e-mail programs and web-
based e-mail services have antispam and filter options that can be
configured. Use them.
In an attempt to control spam, antispam laws have been
added to our legal system. For example, CAN-SPAM requires
that every marketing-related e-mail provide an opt-out
option. When the option is selected, the recipient’s e-mail
address is to be removed from future mailing lists. Failure
to do so results in heavy fines. This approach, however, has
had minimal impact since over 80 percent of all spam
originates from servers outside the United States. A more
effective approach to controlling spam has been the
development and use of spam blockers, also known as spam
filters. Most e-mail programs provide spam-blocking
capabilities.

Search Tools
The web can be an incredible resource, providing information
on nearly any topic imaginable. Are you interested in music?
Writing a paper on the environment? Looking for a movie
review? Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information
sources related to these questions, and much, much more, are
available on the web.
With over 20 billion pages and more being added daily, the
web is a massive collection of interrelated pages. With so
much available information, locating the precise information
you need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of
organizations called search services operate websites that
can help you locate the information you need.
Search services maintain huge databases relating to
information provided on the web and the Internet. The
information stored in these databases includes addresses,
content descriptions or classifications, and keywords
appearing on web pages and other Internet informational
resources. Special automated programs called spiders
continually look for new information and update the search
services’ databases. Additionally, search services provide
special programs called search engines that you can use to
locate specific information on the web.
reset page 137
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs that assist you in
locating information on the web and the Internet. To find
information, you go to a search service’s website and use
its search engine. See Figure 2-18 for a list of commonly
used search engines.
Search Site
Service
Bing www.bing.com
Duckduckgo www.duckduckgo.com
Google www.google.com
Yahoo! www.yahoo.com
Figure 2-18 Search engines
To use a search website, you enter a keyword or phrase
reflecting the information you want. The search engine
compares your entry against its database and returns the
search result, or a list of sites on that topic. Each search
result includes a link to the referenced web page (or other
resource), along with a brief discussion of the information
contained at that location. Many searches result in a large
number of search results. For example, if you were to enter
the keyword music, you would get billions of sites on that
topic. Search engines order the search results according to
those sites that most likely contain the information
requested and present the list to you in that order, usually
in groups of 10.
Because each search service maintains its own database,
the search results returned by one search engine will not
necessarily be the same results returned by another search
engine. Therefore, when researching a topic, it is best to
use more than one search engine.
reset page 138
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Content Evaluation
Search engines are excellent tools to locate information on
the web. Be careful, however, how you use the information you
find. Unlike most published material found in newspapers,
journals, and textbooks, not all the information you find on
the web has been subjected to strict guidelines to ensure
accuracy. In fact, anyone can publish content on the web.
Many sites allow anyone to post new material, sometimes
anonymously and without evaluation. Some sites promote fake
news or information that is inaccurate or biased. This can
include manipulated videos known as deep fakes, where an
individual’s appearance or message is changed. Many of these
sites are designed to look like legitimate news sites.
Before you believe a website’s claims or share that site
with friends and family, consider the following:
Authority. Is the author an expert in the subject area? Is
the site an official site for the information presented, or
is the site an individual’s personal website?
Accuracy. Read beyond the headlines and consult other
reputable sources on any surprising claims to separate the
real news from the fake. Headlines can be page 41
misleading and fake news articles often make their
statements seem accurate by referencing other fake news
articles.
Objectivity. Is the information factually reported, or does
the author have a bias? Does the author appear to have a
personal agenda aimed at convincing or changing the
reader’s opinion?
Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site
specify the date when the site was updated? Are the site’s
links operational? If not, the site is most likely not
being actively maintained.

community
Social media communities share news through likes, comments, and
reposting articles. Unfortunately, many of these articles may be
misleading or outright lies. When a user shares a news article, are
they responsible for verifying that the article is true, or does that
responsibility fall to the reader? Even if the articles are lies,
social networking sites benefit from the clicks and views of these
articles. Do social media companies have a responsibility to identify
or eliminate fake news?
Electronic Commerce
Electronic commerce, also known as e-commerce, is the buying
and selling of goods over the Internet. Electronic commerce
is fast-growing and widely used in part because it provides
incentives for both buyers and sellers. From the buyer’s
perspective, goods and services can be purchased at any time
of day or night from any location that has an Internet
connection. From the seller’s perspective, the costs
associated with owning and operating a retail outlet can be
eliminated. Another advantage is reduced inventory.
Traditional stores maintain an inventory of goods in their
stores and periodically replenish this inventory from
warehouses. With e-commerce, there is no in-store inventory
and products are shipped directly from warehouses.
While there are numerous advantages to e-commerce, there
are disadvantages as well. Some of these disadvantages
reset page 140
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
include the inability to provide immediate delivery of goods,
the inability to “try on” prospective purchases, and
questions relating to the security of online payments.
Although these issues are being addressed, very few observers
suggest that e-commerce will replace brick-and-mortar
businesses entirely. It is clear that both will coexist and
that e-commerce will continue to grow.
Just like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce
involves two parties: businesses and consumers. There are
three basic types of electronic commerce:
Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce involves the sale of a
product or service to the general public or end users. It
is the fastest-growing type of e-commerce. Whether large or
small, nearly every existing corporation in the United
States provides some type of B2C support as another means
to connect to customers. Because extensive investments are
not required to create traditional retail outlets and to
maintain large marketing and sales staffs, e-commerce
allows start-up companies to compete with larger
established firms. The three most widely used B2C
applications are for online banking, financial trading, and
shopping. Amazon.com is one of the most widely used B2C
sites.
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce involves individuals
selling to individuals. C2C often takes the form of an
electronic version of the classified ads or an auction. Web
auctions are similar to traditional auctions except that
buyers and sellers seldom, if ever, meet face to face.
Sellers post descriptions of products at a website, and
buyers submit bids electronically. Like traditional
auctions, sometimes the bidding becomes highly competitive
and enthusiastic. One of the most widely used auction sites
is eBay.com. For a list of some of the most popular C2C
sites, see Figure 2-19.
reset page 141
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Business-to-business (B2B) commerce involves the page 42
sale of a product or service from one business to
another. This is typically a manufacturer–supplier
relationship. For example, a furniture manufacturer
requires raw materials such as wood, paint, and varnish.

Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are (1) developing
fast, secure, and reliable payment methods for purchased
goods and (2) providing convenient ways to submit required
information such as mailing addresses and credit card
information.
The two basic payment options are by credit card and by
digital cash:
Credit card purchases are faster and more convenient than
check purchases. Credit card fraud, however, is a major
concern for both buyers and sellers. We will discuss this
and other privacy and security issues related to the
Internet in Chapter 9.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Digital currency is the Internet’s equivalent to
traditional cash. Buyers purchase digital currency from a
third party (a bank that specializes in electronic
currency) and use it to purchase goods. (See Figure 2-20.)
Most digital currency is a digital version of traditional
currency, such that a digital U.S. dollar has the same
purchasing power as a traditional U.S. dollar. For example,
Facebook’s digital cash, Diem, is tied to the U.S. dollar.
For a list of digital currency providers, see Figure 2-21.
Some digital currencies, like bitcoin, have no traditional
cash equivalent, and their transactions do not involve
third-party banks. Such a currency is called a
cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies use public ledgers, known
as blockchains, to record all transactions of the
cryptocurrency. Anyone can read the blockchain, and anyone
can hold a copy of the blockchain, but it is nearly
impossible to counterfeit the blockchain.

Cloud Computing
Typically, application programs are owned by individuals or
organizations and stored on their computer system’s hard
disks. As discussed in Chapter 1, cloud computing uses the
Internet and the web to shift many of these computer
activities from the user’s computer to other computers on
the Internet.
While some suggest that cloud computing is merely a
marketing term designed to promote new products, many others
see cloud computing as a new model for computing that frees
users from owning, maintaining, and storing software and
data. It provides access to these services from anywhere
through an Internet connection. Several prominent firms are
reset page 144
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
aggressively pursuing this new concept. These firms include
Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, to name just a few.
The basic components of cloud computing are clients, the
Internet, and service providers. (See Figure 2-22.)
Clients are corporations and end users who want access to
data, programs, and storage. This access is to be available
anywhere and anytime that a connection to the page 44
Internet is available. End users do not need to
buy, install, and maintain application programs and data.
The Internet provides the connection between the clients
and the providers. Two of the most critical factors
determining the efficiency of cloud computing are (1) the
speed and reliability of the user’s access to the Internet
and (2) the Internet’s capability to provide safe and
reliable transmission of data and programs.
Service providers are organizations with computers
connected to the Internet that are willing to provide
access to software, data, and storage. These providers may
charge a fee or the services may be free. For example,
Google Drive Apps provide free access to programs with
capabilities similar to Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and
PowerPoint. (See Figure 2-23.)

The Internet of Things
The Internet is becoming more and more a part of our lives.
As discussed in Chapter 1, the Internet of Things (IoT) is
the continuing development of the Internet that allows
everyday objects embedded with electronic devices to send and
receive data over the Internet. These everyday objects
include cell phones, wearable devices, and even coffeemakers.
For example, the Fitbit is a bracelet that monitors health
data and sends that data to your cell phone or personal web
page. (See Figure 2-24.) Google Nest is a collection of IoT
devices for the home that allow you to answer your front door
when you are not home, improve home security, and automate
your home thermostat.

Web developers develop and maintain websites and
resources. The job may include backup of the company
website, updating of resources, or development of new
resources. Web developers are often involved in the design
and development of the website. Some Web developers monitor
traffic on the site and take steps to encourage users to
visit the site. Web developers also may work with marketing
personnel to increase site traffic and may be involved in
the development of web promotions.
Employers look for candidates with a bachelor’s or
associate’s degree in computer science or information
systems and knowledge of common programming languages and
web development software. Knowledge of HTML and PHP is
considered essential. Those with experience using web
authoring software and programs like Adobe Illustrator and
Adobe Dreamweaver are often preferred. Good communication
and organizational skills are vital in this position.
Web developers can expect to earn an annual salary of
$52,000 to $82,000. In larger organizations, this position
may be held by several employees, each specializing in a
specific aspect of the company’s web presence. With
technological advances and increasing corporate emphasis on

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Home Smart Home
The technology in our homes has made dull tasks a little easier. Our
parents’ and grandparents’ lives were changed by the introduction of the
vacuum and the washing machine. Today, our lives are further impacted by
new technologies in the home, and the biggest change is the use of the
Internet. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into our
homes and the use of Web 5.0 technologies is doing more than making boring
tasks easier. The future of technology in our homes is smart devices that
monitor and react to us. These technologies will make our homes easier,
healthier, and more sustainable.
Today, smart home systems like Google’s Nest can adjust your
thermostat to keep your home comfortable and energy bills low. Researchers
at Cambridge Consultants are working on even smarter homes that will
reduce waste, increase savings, and make for a more sustainable world. The
smart home of the future will have smart trash cans that monitor and
separate waste, recyclables, and compostable trash. Recyclables and
compost can be repurposed within the home to create energy and reduce
carbon emissions.
reset page 151
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------

The smart home of the future will do more than clean up and recycle. It
will monitor and adjust energy use based on your needs and the energy
sources available. Interconnected IOT devices will work together to
maximize their efficiency to make for a lower energy home. Devices monitor
inside and outside temperature, news and weather reports, and fluctuating
power availability from home solar panels and community wind turbines.
These homes will also use sensors in the home to predict energy needs,
such as increased hot water in the mornings when people shower and reduced
air conditioning when you go away for a weekend.
Your smart home in the future will not just use less energy. It will
use less space as well. Researchers at Samsung envision a home of smart
walls that use adjustable surfaces and actuators to change the size of a
room effectively, making empty rooms smaller and occupied rooms larger.
When you are entertaining guests, the walls will reposition to create
extra seating directly out of the wall. When the guests leave, the extra
seating disappears back into the wall.
While these advances sound great, perhaps the greatest advantages of a
smart home will be the ability to improve health and longevity. Currently,
researchers are investigating the ways that IoT devices can help people
make healthier choices. The Fitbit and other monitoring IoT wearables have
been shown to increase people’s activity level and improve health. The
smart home of the future will monitor your health and adjust your home to
make healthier choices, from furniture that reads your posture and guides
you to improve how you sit, to refrigerators that monitor your food intake
and promote healthier dining choices. IoT and Web 5.0 will allow smart
homes to work seamlessly in the background to help you achieve your best
you.
Of course, these advances include an increase in potential risks. A
home that records every movement and activity could be used to spy on you.
Companies that store and analyze your smart home data could use that data
reset page 152
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
in ways you haven’t agreed to, such as to sell products or to design and
test new ideas. Finally, by putting your security and privacy in the hands
of a smart home, you risk that smart home being hacked and opening your
home to criminals.
What do you think? Are the conveniences of the smart home of the future
worth the risks to your privacy and security? What smart home features
exist right now that you would like to have? What smart home features that
researchers are working on would be most valuable to you?

Social Networking
Social networking sites connect people and organizations
that share a common interest or activity. Common features
include profiles, pages, groups, friends, news feeds,
and share settings. Two well-known sites are LinkedIn
and Facebook.
Blogs, Microblogs, Podcasts, and Wikis
Other sites that help individuals communicate across the
web are blogs, microblogs, podcasts, and wikis.
Blogs are typically personal websites to keep in touch
with friends and family. Some are like online diaries.
Businesses, newspapers, and others also use blogs as a
quick publishing method.
Microblogs use short sentences. Twitter allows 280
characters per tweet. Instagram is primarily used to
share images and videos.
Podcasts are audio programs delivered over the
Internet. Typically, a podcast is one audio program in
a series of related podcasts.
A wiki is a website designed to allow visitors to use
their browsers to add, edit, or delete the site’s
content. Wikipedia is one of the most popular wikis.

Messaging
Although e-mail is the most widely used, there are two
other messaging systems:

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Text messaging, also known as texting and SMS (short
message service), is a process of sending short
electronic messages, typically fewer than 160
characters. Texting while driving is very dangerous and
illegal in several states.
Instant messaging (IM)—supports live communication
between friends. Most instant messaging programs also
include videoconferencing features, file sharing, and
remote assistance.
E-mail
E-mail (electronic mail) is the transmission of
electronic messages. There are two basic types of e-mail
systems:
Client-based e-mail systems use e-mail clients
installed on your computer.
Web-based e-mail systems use webmail clients located
on the e-mail provider’s computer. This is known as
webmail.
A typical e-mail has three basic elements: header
(including address, subject, and perhaps attachment),
message, and signature.
Description
Spam is unwanted and unsolicited e-mail that may
include a computer virus or destructive programs often
attached to unsolicited e-mail. Spam blockers, also
known as spam filters, are programs that identify and
eliminate spam.

SEARCH TOOLS
Search Site
Service
Bing www.bing.com
Duckduckgo www.duckduckgo.com
Google www.google.com
Yahoo! www.yahoo.com
Search services maintain huge databases relating to
website content. The information stored in these
databases includes addresses, content descriptions or
classifications, and keywords appearing on web pages and
other Internet informational resources. Spiders are
programs that update these databases.
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs to help locate
information. To use, enter a keyword or phrase, and a
list of search results is displayed.
Content Evaluation
Not all information you find on the web has been
subjected to strict guidelines to ensure accuracy. Many
sites allow anyone to post new material, sometimes
anonymously and without critical evaluation. Some sites
promote fake news (inaccurate or biased information)
and/or deep fake videos. Many fake news sites are
designed to look like legitimate news sites.
To evaluate the accuracy of information found on the
web, consider the following:
Authority. Is the author an expert? Is the site
official or does it present one individual’s or
reset page 161
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
organization’s opinion?
Accuracy. Consult other reputable sources to verify
surprising claims. Fake news articles often reference
other fake news articles.
Objectivity. Is the information factual or does the
author have a bias? Does the author appear to have a
personal agenda to convince or form a reader’s
opinion?
Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site
specify when information is updated? Are the site’s
links operational?

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Denys Prykhodov/Shutterstock
Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the buying and
selling of goods over the Internet. Three basic types are
Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce, which involves
sales from business to the general public.
reset page 162
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce, which involves
sales between individuals. Web auctions are similar to
traditional auctions except buyers and sellers rarely,
if ever, meet face to face.
Business-to-business (B2B) commerce, which involves
sales from one business to another, typically a
manufacturer–supplier relationship.
Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are the
development of
Safe, secure payment methods. Two types are credit
cards and digital currency. Bitcoins exist only on the
Internet.
Convenient ways to provide required information.
CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing shifts many computer activities from the
user’s computer to other computers on the Internet. The
three basic components to cloud computing are
Clients—corporations and end users.
Internet—provides connection between clients and
providers.
Service providers—organizations with computers
connected to the Internet that are willing to provide
access to software, data, and storage.
INTERNET of THINGS

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a continuing development
of the Internet allowing everyday objects embedded with
electronic devices to send and receive data over the
Internet. Objects include cell phones, wearable devices,
and even coffeemakers. For example:
The Fitbit is an IoT device (bracelet) that monitors
health data and sends that data to a cell phone or
personal web page.
Apple’s Health App is a Web 3.0 application that can
access Fitbit data, combine it with other related
health data, analyze the data, and report back to you
through a cell phone.
The Apple Health App reports provide information about
users’ health, including heart rate, steps taken each
day, and an estimate of daily calories burned.
