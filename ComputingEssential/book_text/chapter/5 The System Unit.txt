Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Liz, and I’m a computer technician. I’d like to
talk with you about the different types of system units for
personal computers. I’d also like to talk about various
electronic components that make your computer work.”

When choosing a new cell phone, how can you tell which is the more
powerful device? A device’s power lies in its speed, capacity, and
flexibility—all qualities determined by a device’s system unit. Every
computer has a system unit—from cell phones to laptops and desktops. In
learning about the system unit, you will be prepared to make a smart
choice on your next cell phone upgrade, tablet purchase, or even a laptop
or desktop purchase. (The Computer Buyer’s Guide at the end of this book
provides additional information on purchasing the right desktop or laptop
for your needs.)
Sometime you may get the chance to watch when a technician opens up a
personal computer. You will see that it is basically a collection of
electronic circuitry. Although there is no need to understand how all
these components work, it is important to understand the principles. Armed
with this knowledge, you will be able to confidently make sound purchasing
and upgrading decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the functionality of the basic components in the system unit, including
the system board, microprocessor, memory, expansion slots and cards, bus
lines, ports, cables, and power supply units.
System Unit
The system unit, also known as the system chassis, is a
container that houses most of the electronic components that
make up a computer system. Some system units are located in a
separate case, whereas others share a case with other parts
of the computer system.

As we have previously discussed, a personal computer is
the most widely used type of computer. It is the most
affordable and is designed to be operated directly by an end
user. The five most common types are cell phones, tablets,
laptops, desktops, and wearable computers. Each has a unique
type of system unit.
ethics
Many of the electronic devices purchased in the United States are
manufactured in other countries. Some of these manufacturers pay
extremely low wages, have unsafe or unacceptable work conditions, and
pollute the environment. Do you think that consumers have an ethical
responsibility regarding where and/or how products are manufactured?
Smartphones
As we discussed in Chapter 1, almost everyone has a cell
phone, and almost every cell phone is a smartphone.
Smartphones are the most popular type of personal computer.
They are effectively a thin slab that is almost all monitor,
with the system unit, secondary storage, and all electronic
components located behind the monitor. Designed to
comfortably fit into the palm of one hand and accept finger
touches on the monitor as the primary input, cell phones have
become the indispensable handheld computer. (See Figure 5-1.)

Tablets
Tablets, also known as tablet computers, are very similar to
cell phones, although tablets are larger, heavier, and
generally more powerful. Also, a tablet is not designed to be
used as a phone and, typically, cannot be connected to phone
networks. Tablets come in a range of styles and sizes, with
the smallest tablets (called mini tablets) being just a
little larger than the largest cell phones. (See Figure 5-2.)

Laptops
Like cell phones and tablets, laptops have their system units
housed with selected secondary storage and input devices.
Laptops, however, are larger and more powerful. Their larger
monitor is separate from the rest of the computer and
attached to the system unit with a hinge. Unlike cell phones
and tablets, most laptops do not accept input by touching the
reset page 288
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
screen. Rather, laptops typically use an attached keyboard
and a mouse as the primary input devices.
There are several specialized laptops with features that
make them unique. Some of them are
Two-in-one laptops, which include a touch screen and the
ability to fold flat like a tablet computer. These laptops
offer the advantages of a laptop with the convenience of a
tablet. (See Figure 5-3.)
Gaming laptops, which include high-end graphics hardware
and very fast processors. As laptops have become more
powerful, gaming laptops have become a favorite, primarily
due to their portability. To learn more about specialized
gaming computers, see the Making IT Work for You: Gaming on
pages 112 and 113.
Ultrabooks, also known as ultraportables or mini
notebooks, are lighter and thinner with longer battery life
than most laptops. They accomplish these advantages by
leaving out components such as optical drives and using
energy-efficient microprocessors. (See Figure 5-4.)

Desktops
Desktops are the most powerful type of personal computer.
Like cell phones and tablets, some desktop computers, like
Apple’s iMac, have their monitor and system unit housed
together in the same case. These computers are known as all-
in-one desktops. (See Figure 5-5.)

However, most desktops have their system unit in a
separate case. This case contains the system’s electronic
components and selected secondary storage devices. Input and
output devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, are
located outside the system unit. This type of system unit is
designed to be placed either horizontally or vertically.

Desktop system units that are placed vertically are sometimes
referred to as a tower unit or tower computer. (See Figure

GAMING
Would you like to spend less time bored and more time
playing games with friends? Would you like to turn a
simple walk into a sci-fi shoot out or an evening in front
of the TV into an adventure through the Middle Ages? Video
games can turn the mundane into the magical, and with so
many game styles and gaming devices, there is a video game
for every interest and budget.
Mobile Gaming You may already own one of the most popular gaming
devices on the planet—a cell phone. As cell phones have gained powerful
hardware, better screens, and faster Internet connections, they have
become the most popular gaming device. Here are three things you should
know about mobile gaming.
reset page 291
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Casual gaming—Mobile games are often designed to be “casual
games,” meaning the games are easy to pick up and play in short
bursts. This is ideal for someone who wants to play for a few minutes
while waiting in line or taking a break from work. Popular examples of
casual gaming are Super Mario Run and Candy Crush.
Augmented reality—More sophisticated mobile games use the mobile
device’s GPS and camera to create “augmented reality” multiplayer
games, where the game’s graphics are a mixture of video images from
the phone’s camera and fantasy elements in the game realm. Examples
of these games are Pokémon Go and Google’s Ingress Prime.
Hidden costs—A final word of caution on mobile games: Many are free
to play, but there may be hidden costs you should be aware of. Some
games require high data usage that can rack up charges on your phone
bill, and some may try to access personal information on your phone
that you don’t intend to share. Be aware of your data usage, read any
fine print, and exercise caution when a game asks for credit card
information or permission to access data on your phone.
Minecraft and other mobile games are designed to take advantage of cell
phone and tablet interfaces.

Console Gaming The most popular video game hardware isn’t a desktop
or laptop computer. It is a specialized computer called a gaming console.
Consoles have specialized hardware that produce high-quality graphics and
sound and are designed to take advantage of TVs and home theaters. They
provide wireless controllers for playing from the living room couch and
HDMI ports to support standard TV resolutions and sound configurations.
Also, because consoles are standardized and popular, they often have
large libraries of games to choose from.
reset page 292
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The three most popular consoles are Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox
Series X and S, and the Sony PlayStation 5. If you are looking for an
immersive video game that goes beyond the casual gamer experience,
consoles offer great performance at a reasonable price with excellent
online features and gaming libraries. Here are a few things to consider
when deciding what console to purchase:
Friends—If you want to play online games with your friends, you will
need to get the same console that your friends have. If you want to
play games when friends come over to visit, Nintendo offers many of
the most innovative cooperative games with an emphasis on party games
meant to be played together simultaneously.
Input devices—Each console has its own controllers, with page 113
different strengths and weaknesses. Nintendo offers motion-
control controllers that use hand gestures to play games, Sony has a
virtual reality headset, and Microsoft has a sophisticated set of
cameras that can record body position and motion.
Games—Although many games are offered across all consoles, some are
exclusive to only one console. Further, each console has types of
games that they are best known for. Nintendo, for example, tends to
attract more casual and family-friendly gamers, whereas the Xbox is
famous for its intense online competition. Look for a console with a
catalog of games that appeal to you.

PC Gaming While mobile devices and console systems are the most common
and popular gaming devices, gaming desktops and laptops offer
unparalleled experiences that attract video games’ biggest fans. Gaming
reset page 293
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
PCs offer the highest degree of customizability, with specialized
graphics cards and input devices. Although an entry-level gaming desktop
isn’t much more expensive than a typical desktop, the price can quickly
escalate as you approach the cutting edge of graphics and sound
technology. Here are some things to consider before buying a gaming PC:
Indy games—Beyond offering the highest-quality video game
experience, gaming PCs also have access to niche and independent
(indy) video game developers, who cannot easily release games on
consoles or mobile devices.
Upgrades—Desktop PCs allow the computer hobbyist to upgrade hardware
as technology improves. Gamers who are willing to open up their
computer and replace parts can keep their gaming PC playing the newest
games without having to buy a whole new computer.
Compatibility—The fact that PC hardware is so customizable can make
it difficult to be sure that the game you purchase is compatible with
your PC configuration. PC gamers must know their system specifications
when buying video games to be sure that the game will run on their
system.
A powerful gaming PC includes specialized hardware for running high-
performance graphics.

Wearable computers, also known as wearable devices, are one
of the first evolutionary steps to the Internet of Things
(IoT), as discussed in Chapter 2. These devices contain an
embedded computer on a chip that is typically much smaller
and less powerful than a cell phone’s. The most common
wearable computers are smartwatches and activity trackers.
(See Figure 5-7.)
Smartwatches like Apple’s Watch. This device acts as a
watch, fitness monitor, and communication device. For
example, the Apple Watch connects to an iPhone to display
e-mails, text messages, and calendar reminders on the
user’s wrist.
Activity trackers like Garmin Vivoactive 4. This device
monitors daily exercise and sleep patterns. It also
connects wirelessly to desktops, laptops, and smartphones
to record and share data.

System Board
The system board is also known as the mainboard or
motherboard. The system board controls communications for the
entire computer system. All devices and components connect to
the system board, including external devices like keyboards
and monitors and internal components like hard drives drives
and microprocessors. The system board acts as a data path and
traffic monitor, allowing the various components to
communicate efficiently with one another.
For cell phones, tablets, and wearable computers, the
system board is located behind the screen. For laptops and
desktops, the system board is typically located at the bottom
of the system unit or along one side. It is a flat circuit
board covered with a variety of different electronic
components, including sockets, slots, and bus lines. (See
Figure 5-9.)
Sockets provide a connection point for small specialized
electronic parts called chips. Chips consist of tiny
circuit boards etched onto squares of sandlike material

called silicon. These circuit boards can be smaller than
the tip of your finger. (See Figure 5-10.) A chip is also
called a silicon chip, semiconductor, or integrated
circuit. Chips typically are mounted onto chip carriers.
(See Figure 5-11.) These carriers plug either directly into
sockets on the system board or onto cards that are then
plugged into slots on the system board. Sockets are used to
connect the system board to a variety of different types of
chips, including the microprocessor and memory chips.
Slots provide a connection point for specialized cards or
circuit boards. These cards provide expansion capability
for a computer system. For example, a wireless networking
card plugs into a slot on the system board to provide a
connection to a local area network.
Connecting lines called bus lines provide pathways that
support communication among the various electronic
components that are either located on the system board or
attached to the system board.

Many electronics contain toxic materials, such as lead, mercury, and
chromium. If not disposed of properly, these materials can leak into
our water supply, get released into our air, or leach into our soil.
First, consider donating them to various charitable organizations that
work with local schools and low-income families. Otherwise, recycling
electronics allows us to get rid of old devices and keep our community

Generally, the system board found on a desktop is larger
than that found on a laptop, and much larger than one found

communicating between the components of the personal
computer.

Define and describe sockets, slots, and bus lines.
What are chips? How are chips attached to the system board?
Microprocessor
In most personal computer systems, the central processing
unit (CPU) or processor is contained on a single chip called
the microprocessor. The microprocessor is the “brains” of
the computer system. It has two basic components: the control
unit and the arithmetic-logic unit.
Control unit: The control unit tells the rest of the
computer system how to carry out a program’s instructions.
It directs the movement of electronic signals between
memory, which temporarily holds data, instructions, and
processed information, and the arithmetic-logic unit. It
also directs these control signals between the CPU and
input and output devices.
reset page 300
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Arithmetic-logic unit: The arithmetic-logic unit, usually
called the ALU, performs two types of operations:
arithmetic and logical. Arithmetic operations are the
fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Logical operations consist of
comparisons such as whether one item is equal to (=), less
than (<), or greater than (>) the other.
Microprocessor Chips
Microprocessors are an important part of any computing device
and are tailored to the needs of the device it serves. There
are two major categories of microprocessors developed today:
mobile and desktop. Mobile processors are used in cell phones
and tablets and try to strike a balance between the page 117
processing power of the processor and the power the
processor draws from the mobile device’s battery. See Figure
5-12 for a listing of popular mobile processors. Desktop
processors are used in laptops and desktops. These processors
are less concerned with the energy use of the processor and
are more powerful than mobile processors. See Figure 5-13 for
a listing of popular desktop processors. Chip processing
capacities are often expressed in word sizes. A word is the
number of bits (such as 32 or 64) that can be accessed at one
time by the CPU. The more bits in a word, the more data a
computer can process at one time. Eight bits group together
to form a byte. A 32-bit-word computer can access 4 bytes at
a time. A 64-bit-word computer can access 8 bytes at a time.
Therefore, the computer designed to process 64-bit words has
greater processing capacity. Other factors affect a
computer’s processing capability, including how fast it can
process data and instructions.

The processing speed of a microprocessor is typically
represented by its clock speed, which is related to the
number of times the CPU can fetch and process data or
instructions in a second. Older personal computers typically
process data and instructions in millionths of a second, or
microseconds. Newer personal computers are much faster and
process data and instructions in billionths of a second, or
nanoseconds. Supercomputers, by contrast, operate at speeds
measured in picoseconds—1,000 times as fast as personal
computers. In the near future, we can expect processor speeds
to be 1,000 times faster than that, operating at speeds
measured in femtoseconds. (See Figure 5-14.) Logically, the
higher a microprocessor’s clock speed, the faster the
microprocessor. However, some processors can handle multiple
instructions per cycle or tick of the clock; this means that
clock speed comparisons can only be made between processors
that work the same way.

Figure 5-14 Processing speeds
At one time, personal computers were limited by
microprocessors that could support a single CPU that
controlled operations. These computers were limited to
processing one program at a time. Now, many personal
computers have multicore processors that can provide two or
more separate and independent CPUs. For example, a quad-core
processor could have one core computing a complex Excel
spreadsheet, a second core creating a report using Word, a
third core locating a record using Access, and a fourth core
running a multimedia presentation—all at the same time. More
significantly, however, is the potential for personal
computers to run very large, complex programs that previously
required expensive and specialized hardware.
For multicore processors to be used effectively, computers
must understand how to divide tasks into parts that can be
distributed across each core—an operation called parallel
processing. Operating systems such as Windows 11 and macOS
Big Sur support parallel processing. Software developers use
this technology for a wide range of applications from
scientific programs to sophisticated computer games.
Specialty Processors
In addition to microprocessor chips, a variety of more
specialized processing chips have been developed and are
widely used. For example, many cars have more than 100
separate specialty processors to control nearly everything
from fuel efficiency to satellite entertainment and tracking
systems. Coprocessors, one of the more popular specialty
processors, are specialty chips designed to improve specific
reset page 303
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computing operations. For example, to support fast processing
of virtual environments, a standard feature in gaming page 118
computers is a graphics coprocessor known as a GPU
(graphics processing unit). These processors are designed to
handle a variety of specialized tasks such as displaying 3D
images and encrypting data. Most cell phones and tablets have
specialty processors to efficiently show and store videos.
privacy
Did you know that one type of specialty processor is devoted
exclusively to protecting your privacy? Called cryptoprocessors, these
microchips perform encoding and decoding of data faster and more
securely than a CPU. These specialized chips exist in ATMs, TV set-top
boxes, and payment terminals.

Memory
Memory is a holding area for data, instructions, and
information. Like microprocessors, memory is contained on
chips connected to the system board. There are three well-
known types of memory chips: random-access memory (RAM),
read-only memory (ROM), and flash memory.
RAM
reset page 304
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Random-access memory (RAM) chips hold the program (sequence
of instructions) and data that the CPU is presently
processing. (See Figure 5-15.) RAM is called temporary or
volatile storage because everything in most types of RAM is
lost as soon as the computer is turned off. It is also lost
if there is a power failure or other disruption of the
electric current going to the computer.
Figure 5-15 RAM chips mounted on circuit board
daniiD/Shutterstock
Cache (pronounced “cash”) memory improves processing by
acting as a temporary high-speed holding area between the
memory and the CPU. The computer detects which information in
RAM is most frequently used and then copies that information
into the cache. When needed, the CPU can quickly access the
information from the cache.
Having enough RAM is important! For example, to use
Windows 11, Microsoft recommends that your computer have at
least 4 GB, or 4 billion bytes, of RAM. Some applications,
such as photo editing software, may require even more.
Fortunately, additional RAM can be added to a computer system
reset page 305
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
by inserting an expansion module called a DIMM (dual in-line
memory module) into the system board. The capacity or amount
of RAM is expressed in bytes. There are three commonly used
units of measurement to describe memory capacity. (See Figure
5-16.)
Unit Capacity
Megabyte 1 million
(MB) bytes
Gigabyte 1 billion
(GB) bytes
Terabyte 1 trillion
(TB) bytes
Petabyte 1
(PB) quadrillionbytes
Figure 5-16 Memory capacity
Even if your computer does not have enough RAM to hold a
program, it might be able to run the program using virtual
memory. With virtual memory, large programs are divided into
parts, and the parts are stored on a secondary device,
usually a hard disk. Each part is then read into RAM only
when needed. In this way, computer systems are able to run
very large programs.
ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) chips have information stored in them
by the manufacturer. Unlike RAM chips, ROM chips are not
volatile and cannot be changed by the user. “Read only”
means that the CPU can read, or retrieve, data and programs
written on the ROM chip. However, the computer cannot write—
encode or change—the information or instructions in ROM.
reset page 306
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Not long ago, ROM chips were typically used to contain
almost all the instructions for basic computer operations.
For example, ROM instructions are needed to start a computer,
to access memory, and to handle keyboard input. Recently,
however, flash memory chips have replaced ROM chips for many
applications.
Flash Memory
Flash memory offers a combination of the features of RAM and
ROM. Like RAM, it can be updated to store new information.
Like ROM, it does not lose that information when power to the
computer system is turned off.
page 119
Flash memory is used for a wide range of applications. For
example, it is used to store the start-up instructions for a
computer. This information is called the system’s BIOS
(basic input/output system). This information includes the
specifics concerning the amount of RAM and the type of
keyboard, mouse, and secondary storage devices connected to
the system unit. If changes are made to the computer system,
these changes are reflected in flash memory.

memory.

Expansion Cards and Slots
To meet the size constraints of cell phones, tablets, and
laptops, fingernail-size expansion cards known as SD cards
have been developed. These cards plug into expansion slots
located within many cell phones, tablets, and laptops. (See
Figure 5-18.)
Figure 5-18 SD card
tkyszk/Shutterstock
As previously mentioned, many personal computers allow
users to expand their systems by providing expansion slots on
the system board. Users can insert optional devices known as
expansion cards into these slots. (See Figure 5-19.) Ports on
the cards allow cables to be connected from the expansion
cards to devices outside the system unit. (See Figure 5-20.)
There are a wide range of different types of expansion cards.
Some of the most commonly used expansion cards are
Graphics cards, which provide high-quality 3D graphics and
animation for games and simulations. While many personal
reset page 308
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computer systems have a GPU connected directly to the
system board, others connect through a graphics card. This
card can contain one or more GPU chips and is standard for
most gaming computers.
Network interface cards (NIC), also known as network
adapter cards, are used to connect a computer to a network.
(See Figure 5-21.) The network allows connected computers
to share data, programs, and hardware. The network page 120
adapter card connects the system unit to the
network via a network cable.
Wireless network cards allow computers to be connected
without cables. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, wireless
networks in the home are widely used to share a common
Internet connection. Each device on the network is equipped
with a wireless network card that communicates with the
other devices.

Bus Lines
As mentioned earlier, a bus line—also known simply as a bus
—connects the parts of the CPU to each other. Buses also
link the CPU to various other components on the system board.
(See Figure 5-22.) A bus is a pathway for bits representing
data and instructions. The number of bits that can travel
simultaneously down a bus is known as the bus width.
Figure 5-22 Bus is a pathway for bits
raigvi/Shutterstock
A bus is similar to a multilane highway that moves bits
rather than cars from one location to another. The number of
traffic lanes determines the bus width. A highway (bus line)
with more traffic lanes (bus width) can move traffic (data
and instructions) more efficiently. For example, a 64-bit bus
can move twice as much information at a time as a 32-bit bus.
Why should you even care about what a bus line is? Because as
microprocessor chips have changed, so have bus lines. Bus
design or bus architecture is an important factor relating to
the speed and power for a particular computer. Additionally,
reset page 311
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
many devices, such as expansion cards, will work with only
one type of bus.
Every computer system has two basic categories of buses.
One category, called system buses, connects the CPU to memory
on the system board. The other category, called expansion
buses, connects the CPU to other components on the system
board, including expansion slots.

Computer systems typically have a combination of different
types of expansion buses. The principal types are USB,
FireWire, and PCIe.
Universal serial bus (USB) is widely used today. External
USB devices are connected from one to another or to a
common point or hub and then onto the USB bus. The USB bus
then connects to the PCI bus on the system board. The
current USB standard is USB 3.4.
FireWire buses are similar to USB buses but are more
specialized. They are used primarily to connect audio and
video equipment to the system board.
PCI Express (PCIe) is widely used in many of today’s most
powerful computers. Unlike most other buses that share a
single bus line or path with several devices, the PCIe bus
provides a single dedicated path for each connected device.

Ports
A port is a socket for external devices to connect to the
system unit. A cell phone typically uses a port to recharge
its battery. (See Figure 5-23.) Some ports connect directly
to the system board, while others connect to cards that are
inserted into slots on the system board. Some ports are
standard features of most computer systems, and others are
more specialized. (See Figure 5-24.)

Standard Ports
Most desktop and laptop computers come with a standard set of
ports for connecting peripherals, or external devices, such
as a monitor and keyboard. The most common ports are:
reset page 313
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Universal serial bus (USB) ports can be used to connect
several devices to the system unit and are widely used to
connect keyboards, mice, printers, storage devices, and a
variety of specialty devices. A single USB port can be used
to connect many USB devices to the system unit. There are
many types of USB ports.
USB-A is the port found on most laptops and desktops.
USB-B ports are found on peripheral devices, like digital
cameras and cell phones.
USB-C is the newest USB port, found on high-end cell phones
and laptops. USB-C is faster, smaller, and easier to use
than previous USB types. Some USB-C ports also support
Thunderbolt 3, a high-speed version of the USB-C port.
High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ports provide
high-definition video and audio, making it possible to use
a computer as a video jukebox or an HD video recorder.
Ethernet ports are a high-speed networking port that has
become a standard for many of today’s computers. Ethernet
allows you to connect multiple computers for sharing files,
or to a DSL or cable modem for high-speed Internet access.
Specialized Ports
In addition to standard ports, there are numerous specialty
ports. The most common include:
DisplayPorts (DP) are audiovisual ports typically used to
connect large monitors. They are popular on gaming
computers with high-end graphics cards.
DVI (Digital Video Interface) ports connect digital
monitors to your computer. These ports can only send video
signals and cannot send audio signals. They can be found
mainly on desktops.
FireWire ports provide high-speed connections to
specialized FireWire devices such as camcorders and storage

devices.
page 122
Cables
Cables are used to connect exterior devices to the system
unit via the ports. One end of the cable is attached to the
device, and the other end has a connector that is attached to
a matching connector on the port. Standard cables include
USB, HDMI, Thunderbolt, and Ethernet. (See Figure 5-25.)

Power Supply
Computers require direct current (DC) to power their
electronic components and to represent data and instructions.
DC power can be provided indirectly by converting alternating
current (AC) from standard wall outlets or directly from
batteries.
Most cell phones and tablets are powered directly from
batteries that are recharged using an AC adapter. These
adapters plug into standard wall outlets and convert AC to
DC. With cell phones and tablets, a USB cable often
reset page 315
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
connects the AC adapter to the mobile device. Some cell
phones, however, can use a wireless charging platform,
eliminating the cable. (See Figure 5-26.) Most tablets,
mobile devices, and wearable computers can operate only
using battery power. Their AC adapters or charging
platforms are only used to recharge batteries.
Like cell phones and tablets, laptops typically use AC
adapters that are located outside the system unit. (See
Figure 5-27.) Unlike cell phones and tablets, these
computers can be operated either using an AC adapter
plugged into a wall outlet or using battery power. Their
batteries typically provide sufficient power for up to
eight hours before they need to be recharged.
Desktop computers have a power supply unit located within
the system unit. (See Figure 5-28.) This unit plugs into a
standard wall outlet, converts AC to DC, and provides the
power to drive all of the system unit components.

Unlike cell phones, tablets, or laptops, desktop computers

tips
Does your laptop seem to be losing its charge sooner than it
used to? These batteries do lose power over time; however, you
can take some steps to slow down the aging process.
reset page 317
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
1
Balance adapter and battery use. The best practice is to use
the laptop on battery power for a little while without draining it
completely (20 percent charge, for example), followed by charging
it back to 100 percent. Modern batteries should not be drained to
0 percent each day.
2
Calibrate it. Your laptop’s manufacturer will recommend that you
calibrate, or reset, your battery every few months. Follow its
guidelines on the web or in your instruction manual, as it will
ensure that the battery meter in your operating system is accurate
and that you are getting the expected charge time.
3
Avoid excessive heat. High temperatures can accelerate the
deterioration of modern batteries. Therefore, avoid exposure to
excessive heat and consider purchasing a laptop cooler or fan.
4
Proper storage. If you are not going to use your laptop for a few
weeks, most manufacturers recommend that you remove the battery.

Electronic Data and Instructions
Have you ever wondered why it is said that we live in a
digital world? It’s because computers cannot recognize
information the same way you and I can. People follow
instructions and process data using letters, numbers, and
special characters. For example, if we wanted someone to add
the numbers 3 and 5 together and record the answer, we might
say “please add 3 and 5.” The system unit, however, is
electronic circuitry and cannot directly process such a
request.
reset page 318
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Our voices create analog, or continuous, signals that vary
to represent different tones, pitches, and volume. Computers,
however, can recognize only digital electronic signals.
Before any processing can occur within the system unit, a
conversion must occur from what we understand to what the
system unit can electronically process.
Numeric Representation
What is the most fundamental statement you can make about
electricity? It is simply this: It can be either on or off.
Indeed, many forms of technology can make use of this two-
state on/off, yes/no, present/absent arrangement. For
instance, a light switch may be on or off, or an electric
circuit open or closed. A specific location on a tape or disk
may have a positive charge or a negative charge. This is the
reason, then, that a two-state or binary system is used to
represent data and instructions.
The decimal system that we are all familiar with has 10
digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The binary system,
however, consists of only two digits—0 and 1. Each 0 or 1 is
called a bit—short for binary digit. In the system unit, the
1 can be represented by a negative charge and the 0 by no
electric charge. In order to represent numbers, letters, and
special characters, bits are combined into groups of eight
called bytes. Whenever you enter a number into a page 124
computer system, that number must be converted
into a binary number before it can be processed.
tips
Is your cell phone struggling to make it through the day on a

Power, and finally Battery.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen, then choose Battery.
2
Reduce screen brightness. One of the greatest drains on your
cell phone’s battery is the monitor. By reducing screen
brightness, you can greatly extend your battery life.
For Android cell phones: Swipe down from the top of the screen
to display the notification shade and then adjust the
brightness slider (an icon that looks like a sun) to lower your
screen brightness.
For iOS cell phones: Swipe down from the top-right corner of
the screen to display the control center and then adjust the
brightness bar (an icon that looks like a sun) to lower your
screen brightness.
3
Reduce background services. When your battery gets low, you can
set your cell phone to reduce its battery usage by performing
background processes less frequently.
For Android: Swipe down from the top of the screen to display
the notification shade and tap the Battery Saver button.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and choose Battery and tap the Low Power Mode button.
Any number can be expressed as a binary number. Binary
numbers, however, are difficult for humans to work with
because they require so many digits. Instead, binary numbers
are often represented in a format more readable by humans.
The hexadecimal system, or hex, uses 16 digits (0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) to represent binary
numbers. Each hex digit represents four binary digits, and
two hex digits are commonly used together to represent 1 byte
(8 binary digits). (See Figure 5-29.) You may have already
seen hex when selecting a color in a website design or
drawing application, or when entering the password for access
to a wireless network.

Character Encoding
As we’ve seen, computers must represent all numbers with the
binary system internally. What about text? How can a computer
provide representations of the nonnumeric characters we use
to communicate, such as the sentence you are reading now? The
answer is character encoding schemes or standards.
Character encoding standards assign a unique sequence of
bits to each character. Historically, personal computers used
the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) to represent characters, while mainframe
reset page 321
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computers used EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal
Interchange Code). These schemes were quite effective;
however, they are limited. ASCII, for example, only uses 7
bits to represent each character, which means that only 128
total characters could be represented. This was fine for most
characters in the English language but was not large enough
to support other languages such as Chinese and Japanese.
These languages have too many characters to be represented by
the 7-bit ASCII code.
The explosion of the Internet and subsequent globalization
of computing have led to a new character encoding called
Unicode. The Unicode standard is the most widely used
character encoding standard and is recognized by virtually
every computer system. The first 128 characters are assigned
the same sequence of bits as ASCII to maintain compatibility
with older ASCII-formatted information. However, Unicode uses
a variable number of bits to represent each character, which
allows non-English characters and special characters to be
represented. Unicode can be written in UTF-16 or UTF-8. UTF-
16 is the older Unicode standard, and each character is a
minimum of 16 bits. The newer standard, UTF-8, can have
characters as small as 8 bits, making it more efficient than
UTF-16.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Brain–Computer Interfaces
Can you imagine a future when we become half human and half machine?
Today, we use computer implants to help people hear and to control their
heartbeat. Computer chips are being implanted into people with
Parkinson’s disease to help them control their movements and to reduce
other impacts of the condition. But these devices are simple compared to
the future of brain–computer interfaces imagined by the researchers and
entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.
The human brain stores information in neurons using electrical
impulses. Using neural imaging, specialized equipment can read the
intensity and location of these impulses or thought patterns. This
technology currently allows amputees to control robotic limbs. This case
and almost all other applications, however, require brain surgery and
cumbersome equipment. Researchers are currently trying to reduce the size
and invasiveness of these technologies. Scientists at Florida
International University are investigating devices so small that they can
travel through the bloodstream to the brain. In the future, a simple shot
may allow your computer to tell what you are thinking.
reset page 324
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Elnur/Shutterstock
With improvements in the quality of neural imaging and neural hardware,
we may soon be able to image all the brain’s electrical impulses. For
example, when you think of turning on the house lights, a computer can
take an image of your brain thinking about turning on the house lights.
Later, when you have that thought again, the computer can compare your
brain’s image to previous images and realize that when those areas of the
brain are active, you want the house lights to turn on.
Not only may computers someday read your mind—they someday may write
to it as well. Memories are stored in the electrical impulses of the
brain, and by injecting tiny magnetic particles into the brain, scientists
can stimulate neurons, essentially creating memories. Currently, our
understanding of how the brain operates is too limited, and our ability to
manipulate neurons is too coarse, to allow us to accurately transmit
information. However, someday you may think, “I would like to be able to
speak French,” and through neural stimulation, a computer would generate
the memories necessary for you to speak French.
Many ethicists are concerned by the potential use of such technologies
to improve human abilities instead of treating medical conditions. For
example, with tiny chips being able to store so much, people could use
brain implants to improve their memory. This can lead to a variety of
scenarios where the individual with the implants would have an advantage
over those who don’t have them. However, others disagree, arguing that
the integration of technology and biology is to be expected and it is
nothing more than the next step in human evolution. If such a technology
became widespread and affordable, would you opt to receive a chip implant?

to understand the functionality of the basic components
in the system unit: system board, microprocessor,
memory, expansion slots and cards, bus lines, ports,
and cables. Additionally, you need to understand how
data and programs are represented electronically.
MICROPROCESSOR
In most personal computers, the central processing unit
(CPU), or processor, is contained on a single chip
called the microprocessor. It has two basic components:
a control unit and ALU.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Microprocessor Chips
A word is the number of bits that can be accessed by the
microprocessor at one time. Clock speed represents the
number of times the CPU can fetch and process data or
instructions in a second.
Multicore processors can provide multiple independent
CPUs. Parallel processing requires programs that allow
multiple processors to work together to run large complex
programs.
Specialty Processors
Specialty processors include graphics coprocessors, also
known as GPU or graphics processing unit (processes
graphic images), and processors in automobiles (monitor
fuel efficiency, satellite entertainment, and tracking
systems).
MEMORY
Memory holds data, instructions, and information. There
are three types of memory chips.
RAM
RAM (random-access memory) chips are called temporary or
volatile storage because their contents are lost if power
is disrupted.
Cache memory is a high-speed holding area for
frequently used data and information.
DIMM (dual in-line memory module) is used to expand
memory.
Virtual memory divides large programs into parts that
are read into RAM as needed.
ROM

Flash Memory
Flash memory does not lose its contents when power is
removed.
EXPANSION CARDS AND SLOTS

SD cards are fingernail-size expansion cards used
primarily for laptop computers, tablets, and cell phones.
They connect to expansion slots within these devices.
Many computers allow users to expand their systems by
providing expansion slots on their system boards to
accept expansion cards.
Examples of expansion cards include graphics cards,
network interface cards (NIC; network adapter cards),
and wireless network cards.
BUS LINES
Bus lines, also known as buses, provide data pathways
that connect various system components. Bus width is the
number of bits that can travel simultaneously.
