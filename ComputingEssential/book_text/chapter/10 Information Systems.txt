Why should I read this chapter?
A simple online purchase requires a tremendous collection of carefully
planned and executed jobs. If you buy a some sports equipment online,
your purchase becomes part of a complex stream of information that allow
a company to succeed, employees to flourish, and you to get your sports
equipment. The ability to gather, analyze, and respond to data, like the
data generated when you make an online purchase, can mean the difference
between a company giving employees bonuses or layoff notices. The best
information systems automatically adjust to their environments and help
organizations react to current and future changes.

Introduction
“Hi,
I’m Sue, and I’m an information systems manager. I’d
like to talk with you about how organizations use computer
information systems. I’d also like to talk about specialized

knowledge work systems that assist managers, engineers, and
scientists make decisions.”
An information system is a collection of people, procedures, software,
hardware, data, and connectivity (as we discussed in Chapter 1). They all
work together to provide information essential to running an organization.
This information is critical to successfully produce a product or service
and, for profit-oriented enterprises, to derive a profit.

Why are computers used in organizations? At a basic level, computers
are used to record events. A computer will record the details of a sale
made in a store or update a database to recognize that an item sold has
reduced inventory. However, at a deeper level, computers are used to make
decisions. The data from sales in stores will decide employee bonuses. The
data about inventory items will identify market trends and affect what is
manufactured next season. In this chapter, you will learn how businesses
collect and use information to make decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers within an organization,
you need to understand how the information flows as it moves through an
organization’s different functional areas and management levels. You need
to be aware of the different types of computer-based information systems,
including transaction processing systems, management information systems,
decision support systems, and executive support systems. You also need to
understand the role and importance of databases to support each level or
type of information system.
Organizational Information Flow
reset page 607
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Computerized information systems do not just keep track of
transactions and day-to-day business operations. They also
support the vertical and horizontal flow of information
within the organization. To understand this, we need to
understand how an organization is structured. One way to
examine an organization’s structure is to view it from a
functional perspective. That is, you can study the different
basic functional areas in organizations and the different
types of people within these functional areas.
As we describe these, consider how they apply to a
hypothetical manufacturer of sporting goods, the HealthWise
Group. This company manufactures equipment for sports and
physical activities. Its products range from soccer balls to
yoga mats. (See Figure 10-1.)

Like many organizations, HealthWise Group can be viewed
from a functional perspective with various management levels.
Effective operations require an efficient and coordinated
flow of information throughout the organization.
Functions
Depending on the services or products they provide, most
organizations have departments that specialize in one of five
basic functions. These are accounting, marketing, human
resources, production, and research. (See Figure 10-2.)
page 249
Accounting records all financial activity from billing
customers to paying employees. The HealthWise accounting
department tracks all sales, payments, and transfers of
funds. It also produces reports detailing the financial
condition of the company.
Marketing plans, prices, promotes, sells, and distributes
the organization’s goods and services. HealthWise’s goods
include a wide range of products related to sports and
other types of physical activity.
Human resources focuses on people—hiring, training,
promoting, and any number of other human-centered
activities within the organization. At HealthWise, human
resources is responsible for implementing a new benefits
package, for hiring new skilled workers, and much more.
Production actually creates finished goods and services
using raw materials and personnel. HealthWise manufacturers
a variety of sports equipment, including yoga mats.
Research identifies, investigates, and develops new
products and services. For example, at HealthWise,
reset page 609
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
scientists are investigating a light, inexpensive alloy for
a new line of weight-training equipment.
Figure 10-2 The five functions of an organization
Description
page 250
Although the titles may vary, nearly every large and small
organization has departments that perform these basic
functions. Whatever your job in an organization, it is likely
to be in one of these functional areas.
Management Levels
The foundation of any organization is not managers, but the
employees who produce goods and services. These employees are
reset page 610
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the base of the organizational pyramid and consist of
assemblers, painters, welders, drivers, and others. Above
them are various levels of managers—people with titles such
as supervisor, director, regional manager, and vice
president. These are the people who do the planning, leading,
organizing, and controlling necessary to see that the work
gets done.
For example, the northwest district sales manager for
HealthWise directs and coordinates all the salespeople in her
area. Other job titles might be vice president of marketing,
director of human resources, or production manager. In
smaller organizations, these titles are often combined.
Management in many organizations is divided into three
levels. These levels are supervisors, middle management, and
top management. (See Figure 10-3.)
Supervisors: Supervisors manage and monitor the employees
or workers. Thus, these managers have responsibility
relating to operational matters. They monitor day-to-day
events and immediately take corrective action, if
necessary.
Middle management: Middle-level managers deal with
control, planning (also called tactical planning), and
decision making. They implement the long-term goals of the
organization.
Top management: Top-level managers are concerned with
long-range planning (also called strategic planning). They
need information that will help them plan the future growth
and direction of the organization.

Information Flow
Each level of management has different information needs.
Top-level managers need summary information describing the
overall operations of the business. They also need
information from outside the organization because top-level
managers need to forecast and plan for long-range events.
Middle-level managers need summarized information—weekly or
monthly reports. They need to develop budget projections and
to evaluate the performance of supervisors. Supervisors need
detailed, very current, day-to-day information on their units
so that they can keep operations running smoothly. (See
Figure 10-4.)

To support these different needs, information flows in
different directions. (See Figure 10-5.) For top-level
managers, the flow of information from within the
organization is both vertical and horizontal. The top-level
managers, such as the chief executive officer (CEO), need
information from below and from all departments. They also
need information from outside the organization. For example,
HealthWise is deciding whether to introduce a line of fitness
trackers in the southwestern United States. The vice
president of marketing must look at relevant data. Such data
might include the number of people currently using the
HealthWise fitness app and census data about the number of
young people. It also might include sales histories on
related fitness monitoring equipment.

Figure 10-5 Information flow within an organization
Description
For middle-level managers, the HealthWise information flow
is both vertical and horizontal across functional lines. For
example, the regional sales managers set their sales goals by
coordinating with middle managers in the production
department. They are able to tell sales managers what
products will be produced, how many, and when. The regional
sales managers also must coordinate with the strategic goals
set by the top managers. They must set and monitor the sales
goals for the supervisors beneath them.
page 252
For supervisory managers, information flow is primarily
vertical. That is, supervisors communicate mainly with their
middle managers and with the workers beneath them. For
instance, at HealthWise, production supervisors rarely
communicate with people in the accounting department.
reset page 614
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
However, they are constantly communicating with production-
line workers and with their own managers.
Now we know how many organizations are structured and how
information flows within the organization. But how is a
computer-based information system likely to be set up to
support its needs? And what do you need to know to use it?

Computer-Based Information
Systems
Almost all organizations have computer-based information
systems. Large organizations typically have formal names for
the systems designed to collect and use the data. Although
different organizations may use different names, the most
common names are transaction processing, management
information, decision support, and executive support systems.
(See Figure 10-6.)

Figure 10-6 Types of computer-based information systems
Description
Transaction processing system: The transaction processing
system (TPS) records day-to-day transactions, such as
customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and production
output. The TPS helps supervisors by generating databases
that act as the foundation for the other information
systems.
Management information system: The management information
system (MIS) summarizes the detailed data of the
transaction processing system in standard reports for
middle-level managers. Such reports might include weekly
sales and production schedules.
Decision support system: The decision support system
(DSS) provides a flexible tool for analysis. The DSS helps
middle-level managers and others in the organization
analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of
events and trends outside the organization. Like the MIS,
the DSS draws on the detailed data of the transaction
processing system.
reset page 616
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Executive support system: The executive support system
(ESS), also known as the executive information system
(EIS), is an easy-to-use system that presents information
in a very highly summarized form. It helps top-level
managers oversee the company’s operations and develop
strategic plans. The ESS combines the databases generated
from the TPS and the reports generated from the MIS with
external data.

Transaction Processing Systems
A transaction processing system (TPS) helps an organization
keep track of routine operations and records these events in
a database. For this reason, some firms call this the data
processing system (DPS). The data from operations—for
example, customer orders for HealthWise’s products—makes up
a database that records the transactions of the company. This
database of transactions is used to support the MIS, DSS, and
ESS.
One of the most essential transaction processing systems
for any organization is in the accounting area. (See Figure
10-7.) Every accounting department handles six basic
activities. Five of these are sales order processing,
accounts receivable, inventory and purchasing, accounts
reset page 617
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
payable, and payroll. All of these are recorded in the
general ledger, the sixth activity.
Figure 10-7 Transaction processing system for accounting
page 254
Let us take a look at these six activities. They will make
up the basis of the accounting system for almost any
organization you might work in.
The sales order processing activity records the customer
requests for the company’s products or services. At
HealthWise when an order comes in—a request for a set of
barbells, for example—the warehouse is alerted to ship a
product.
The accounts receivable activity records money received
from or owed by customers. HealthWise keeps track of bills
paid by sporting goods stores and by gyms and health clubs
to which it sells directly.
The parts and finished goods that the company has in stock
are called inventory. At HealthWise this would include all
exercise machines, footballs, soccer balls, and yoga mats
ready for sale in the warehouse. (See Figure 10-8.) An
reset page 618
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
inventory control system keeps records of the number of
each kind of part or finished good in the warehouse.
Purchasing is the buying of materials and services.
Often a purchase order is used. This is a form that shows
the name of the company supplying the material or service
and what is being purchased.
Accounts payable refers to money the company owes its
suppliers for materials and services it has received. At
HealthWise this would include materials such as steel and
aluminum used to manufacture its exercise equipment.
The payroll activity is concerned with calculating employee
paychecks. Amounts are generally determined by the pay
rate, hours worked, and deductions (such as taxes, Social
Security, medical insurance). Paychecks may be calculated
from employee time cards or, in some cases, supervisors’
time sheets.
The general ledger keeps track of all summaries of all the
foregoing transactions. A typical general ledger system can
produce income statements and balance sheets. Income
statements show a company’s financial performance—income,
expenses, and the difference between them for a specific
time period. Balance sheets list the overall financial
condition of an organization. They include assets (for
example, buildings and property owned), liabilities
(debts), and how much of the organization (the equity) is
owned by the owners.

registration systems, which track student enrollments; and
supermarket discount cards, which track customer purchases.

Management Information Systems
reset page 620
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
A management information system (MIS) is a computer-based
information system that produces standardized reports in
summarized structured form. (See Figure 10-9.) It is used to
support middle managers. An MIS differs from a transaction
processing system in a significant way. Whereas a transaction
processing system creates databases, an MIS uses databases.
Indeed, an MIS can draw from the databases of several
departments. Thus, an MIS requires a database management
system that integrates the databases of the different
departments. Middle managers often need summary data drawn
from across different functional areas.
Figure 10-9 Management information system report
An MIS produces reports that are predetermined. That is,
they follow a predetermined format and always show the same
kinds of content. Although reports may differ from one
industry to another, there are three common categories of
reports: periodic, exception, and demand.
Periodic reports are produced at regular intervals—weekly,
monthly, or quarterly, for instance. Examples are
HealthWise’s monthly sales and production reports. The
sales reports from district sales managers are combined
reset page 621
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
into a monthly report for the regional sales managers. For
comparison purposes, a regional manager is also able to see
the sales reports of other regional managers.
Exception reports call attention to unusual events. An
example is a sales report that shows that certain items are
selling significantly above or below marketing department
forecasts. For instance, if fewer exercise bicycles are
selling than were predicted for the northwest sales region,
the regional manager will receive an exception report. That
report may be used to alert the district managers and
salespeople to give this product more attention.
The opposite of a periodic report, a demand report is
produced on request. An example is a report on the numbers
and types of jobs held by women and minorities. Such a
report is not needed periodically, but it may be required
when requested by the U.S. government. At HealthWise, many
government contracts require this information. It is used
to certify that HealthWise is within certain government
equal-opportunity guidelines.

page 256
Decision Support Systems
Managers often must deal with unanticipated questions. For
example, the Health-Wise manager in charge of manufacturing
reset page 622
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
might ask how an anticipated labor strike would affect
production schedules. A decision support system (DSS)
enables managers to get answers to such unexpected and
generally nonrecurring kinds of problems.
A DSS is quite different from a transaction processing
system, which simply records data. It is also different from
a management information system, which summarizes data in
predetermined reports. A DSS is used to analyze data.
Moreover, it produces reports that do not have a fixed
format. This makes the DSS a flexible tool for analysis.
A DSS must be easy to use—or most likely it will not be
used at all. A HealthWise marketing manager might want to
know which territories are not meeting their monthly sales
quotas. To find out, the executive could ask or query the
sales database for all “SALES < QUOTA.” (See Figure 10-10.)

SALES < QUOTA

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
How does a decision support system work? Essentially, it
consists of four parts: the user, system software, data, and
decision models.
The user could be you. In general, the user is someone who
has to make decisions—a manager, often a middle-level
manager.
System software is essentially the operating system—
programs designed to work behind the scenes to handle
detailed operating procedures. In order to give the user a
good, intuitive interface, the software typically is menu
or icon driven. That is, the screen presents easily
understood lists of commands or icons, giving the user
several options.
Data in a DSS is typically stored in a database and
consists of two kinds. Internal data—data from within the
organization—consists principally of transactions from the
transaction processing system. External data is data
gathered from outside the organization. Examples are data
provided by marketing research firms, trade associations,
and the U.S. government (such as customer profiles, census
data, and economic forecasts).
Decision models give the DSS its analytical capabilities.
There are three basic types of decision models: strategic,
tactical, and operational. Strategic models assist top-
level managers in long-range planning, such as stating
company objectives or planning plant locations. page 257
Tactical models help middle-level managers control
the work of the organization, such as financial planning
and sales promotion planning. Operational models help
lower-level managers accomplish the organization’s day-to-
day activities, such as evaluating and maintaining quality
control.
Some DSSs are specifically designed to support more than
one or a team of decision makers. These systems, known as
reset page 624

group decision support systems (GDSS), include tools to
support group meetings and collective work.
concept check
What is the purpose of a decision support system?
Describe the four parts of a DSS.
Identify three basic types of decision models.
Executive Support Systems
Using a DSS requires some training. Many top managers have
other people in their offices running DSSs and reporting
their findings. Top-level executives also want something more
concise than an MIS—something that produces very focused
reports.Executive
support systems (ESSs) consist of sophisticated
software that, like an MIS or a DSS, can present, summarize,
and analyze data from an organization’s databases. However,
an ESS is specifically designed to be easy to use. This is so
that a top executive with little spare time, for example, can
obtain essential information without extensive training.
Thus, information is often displayed in a very condensed form
with informative graphics.
Consider an executive support system used by the president
of HealthWise. It is available on his personal computer. The
first thing each morning, the president calls up the ESS on
his display screen, as shown in Figure 10-11. Note that the
screen gives a condensed account of activities in the five
different areas of the company. (These are Accounting,
Marketing, Production, Human Resources, and Research.) On
this particular morning, the ESS shows business in four areas
proceeding smoothly. However, in the first area, Accounting,
reset page 625
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
the percentage of late-paying customers—past due accounts—
has increased by 3 percent. Three percent may not seem like
much, but HealthWise has had a history of problems with late
payers, which has left the company at times strapped for
cash. The president decides to find out the details. To do
so, he selects 1. Accounting.
Figure 10-11 Opening screen for an executive support system

Within moments, the display screen displays a graph of the
past due accounts. (See Figure 10-12.) The status of today’s
late payers is shown in red. The status of late payers at

this time a year ago is shown in yellow. The differences
between today and a year ago are significant and clearly
presented. For example, approximately $60,000 was late 1 to
10 days last year. This year, over $80,000 was late. The
president knows that he must take some action to speed up
customer payments. (For example, he might call this to the
attention of the vice president of accounting. The vice
president might decide to implement a new policy that offers
discounts to early payers or charge higher interest to late
payers.)

ESSs permit a firm’s top executives to gain direct access
to information about the company’s performance. Most provide
reset page 627
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
direct electronic communication links to other executives. In
addition, some ESSs have the ability to retrieve information
from databases outside the company, such as business-news
services. This enables a firm to watch for stories on
competitors and stay current on relevant news events that
could affect its business. For example, news of increased
sports injuries caused by running and aerobic dancing, and
the consequent decrease in people’s interest in these
activities, might cause HealthWise to alter its sales and
production goals for its line of fitness-related shoes.
For a summary of the different types of information
systems, see Figure 10-13.

Other Information Systems
We have discussed only four information systems: TPSs to
support lower-level managers, MISs and DSSs to support
middle-level managers, and ESSs to support top-level
managers. There are many other information systems to support
different individuals and functions. The fastest growing are
information systems designed to support information workers.
Information workers distribute, communicate, and create
information. They are the organization’s administrative
assistants, clerks, engineers, and scientists, to name a few.
Some are involved with distribution and communication of
information (like administrative assistants and clerks; see
Figure 10-14). They are called data workers. Others are
involved with the creation of information (like the engineers
and scientists). They are called knowledge workers.

Two systems to support information workers are
Office automation systems: Office automation systems
(OASs) are designed primarily to support data workers.
These systems focus on managing documents, communicating,
and scheduling. Documents are managed using word
processing, web authoring, desktop publishing, and other
image technologies. Project managers are programs designed
to schedule, plan, and control project resources. Microsoft
Project is the most widely used project manager.
Videoconferencing systems are computer systems that allow
people located at various geographic locations to

communicate and have in-person meetings. (See Figure 10-

Knowledge work systems: Knowledge workers use OAS systems.
Additionally, they use specialized information systems
called knowledge work systems (KWSs) to create information
in their areas of expertise. For example, engineers
involved in product design and manufacturing use computer-
aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)
systems. (See Figure 10-16.) These KWSs consist of powerful
personal computers running special programs that integrate
the design and manufacturing activities. CAD/CAM is widely
used in the manufacture of automobiles and other products.

Expert Systems
People who are expert in a particular area—certain kinds of
medicine, accounting, engineering, and so on—are generally
well paid for their specialized knowledge. Unfortunately for
their clients and customers, these experts are expensive and
not always available.
What if you were to somehow capture the knowledge of a
human expert and make it accessible to everyone through a
computer program? This is exactly what is being done with
expert systems. Expert systems, also known as knowledge-
based systems, are a type of artificial intelligence that
uses a database to provide assistance to users. This
database, known as a knowledge base, contains facts and rules
to relate these facts distilled from a human expert. Users
interact with an expert system by describing a particular
situation or problem. The expert system takes the inputs and

searches the knowledge base until a solution or

Information systems managers oversee the work of
programmers, computer specialists, systems analysts, and
other computer professionals. They create and implement
corporate computer policy and systems.
Most companies look for individuals with strong
technical backgrounds, sometimes as consultants, with a
master’s degree in business. Employers seek individuals
with strong leadership and excellent communication skills.
Information systems managers must be able to communicate
with people in technical and nontechnical terms.
Information systems management positions are often filled
by individuals who have been consultants or managers in
previous positions. Those with experience in computer and
network security will be in demand as businesses and
society continue to struggle with important security
issues.
Information systems managers can expect an annual salary
of $90,430 to $208,000. Advancement opportunities typically
include leadership in the field.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
IBM’s Watson: The Ultimate Information-Finding
Machine
Have you noticed how much information is out there, from books and
journals in your library to the millions of articles on the web? Do you
ever wonder how professionals manage to read through all that research in
reset page 634
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
order to stay up to date in their field? Recently, as the amount of
information increases, those professionals are finding it difficult to
keep up. In the future, IBM hopes to change that through its information-
finding supercomputer known as Watson. Technology has been making better
information tools, and will continue to evolve to improve our lives as we
look to the future.
In 2011, Watson made headlines by defeating the two best contestants in
the game show Jeopardy. What made the achievement so remarkable was that
the computer had to read the question, understand what was being asked,
search through 200 million pages of text, figure out what the best answer
would be, and then hit a buzzer before the other contestants to deliver
the answer. It accomplished all these steps in about 3 seconds.
With this skill, IBM predicts that Watson could be the ultimate
researcher, helping professionals in various industries find the
information they are looking for in a matter of seconds. Several
organizations have already “hired” Watson. One healthcare company will
be using Watson to help suggest options based on a patient’s unique
circumstances. It assists physicians and nurses by looking through
millions of pages of medical research and then quickly identifying the
most likely diagnosis and treatment options for the patient. To help
Watson learn more about the medical field, IBM has partnered with a cancer
center in order to “teach” Watson how to process the massive amount of
cancer-related research and case studies. In the finance field, Watson has
recently been learning about the complexities of Wall Street, with the
hopes that it can help financial firms identify risks and rewards to
improve the advice given to their customers.

In the future, IBM envisions Watson’s technology being an integral
part of these two industries. In addition, it sees practical applications
in call centers and technical support services. Countless organizations

technology became widespread. It would transform the way all of us do
research and seek answers for our toughest problems.
Since Watson’s debut, many other companies have developed similar
systems. Ride-sharing company Uber uses Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive
Services to verify the identity of its drivers. The United Kingdom’s
National Health Services uses Quill, developed by Narrative Science, to
analyze medical research documents and patient data to assist medical
doctors in treating patients. They also use DeepMind, developed by Google,
to analyze medical test results and to propose specific treatment options
for patients.
What do you think about these powerful services? Do you think you could
one day have access to this powerful technology on your favorite search
engine? How about at home? Do you believe it will be a beneficial support
tool or a machine that threatens to take jobs away from professionals?

ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW
reset page 636
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Information flows in an organization through functional
areas and between management levels.
Functions
Most organizations have separate departments to perform
five functions:
Accounting—tracks all financial activities and
generates periodic financial statements.
Marketing—advertises, promotes, and sells the product
(or service).
Production—makes the product (or service) using raw
materials and people to turn out finished goods.
Human resources—finds and hires people; handles such
matters as sick leave, retirement benefits, evaluation,
compensation, and professional development.
Research—conducts product research and development;
monitors and troubleshoots new products.
Management Levels
The three basic management levels are
reset page 637
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Top level—concerned with long-range planning and
forecasting.
Middle level—deals with control, planning, decision
making, and implementing long-term goals.
Supervisors—control operational matters, monitor day-
to-day events, and supervise workers.
Information Flow
Information flows within an organization in different
directions.
For top-level managers, the information flow is
primarily upward from within the organization and into
the organization from the outside.
For middle-level managers, the information flow is
horizontal and vertical within departments.
For supervisors, the information flow is primarily
vertical.

To efficiently and effectively use computers within an
organization, you need to understand how information
flows through functional areas and management levels.
You need to be aware of the different types of
computer-based information systems, including
transaction processing systems, management information
systems, decision support systems, and executive
support systems.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
reset page 638
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Transaction Processing Systems
Transaction processing systems (TPSs), sometimes called
data processing systems (DPSs), record day-to-day
transactions. Accounting activities include sales order
processing, accounts receivable, inventory and
purchasing, accounts payable, payroll, and general
ledger. A general ledger is used to produce income
statements and balance sheets.
Management Information Systems
Management information systems (MISs) produce
predetermined reports (periodic, exception, demand).
Decision Support Systems
Decision support systems (DSSs) focus on unanticipated
questions; consist of the user, system software, data
(internal and external), and decision models. Three
types are strategic, tactical, and operational. Group
decision support systems (GDSS) support a team of
decision makers.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Executive Support Systems
Executive support systems (ESSs) are similar to MIS or
DSS but easier to use. ESSs are designed specifically for
top-level decision makers.
Other Information Systems
Many other systems are designed to support information
workers who create, distribute, and communicate
information. Three such systems are
Office automation systems (OASs), which support data
workers who are involved with distribution and
communication of information. Project managers and
videoconferencing systems are OASs.
Knowledge work systems (KWSs), which support
knowledge workers, who create information. Many
engineers use computer-aided design/computer-aided
manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.
Expert (knowledge-based) systems, which are a type of
knowledge work system. They use knowledge bases to
apply expert knowledge to specific user problems.
CAREERS in IT
Information systems managers oversee a variety of other
computer professionals. Strong leadership and
communication skills are required; experience as a
consultant and/or manager is desired. Expected salary
range is $90,430 to $208,000.
