Why should I read this chapter?
Secondary storage is vital to keeping our data safe, secure, and
available. If you run out of secondary storage, your cell phone won’t
take videos, your laptop won’t install apps, and your tablet will slow
to a crawl. The future of secondary storage looks to hold even more
information in smaller packages using holograms or even organic molecules
to store data.

Secondary storage is how we store, protect, and transport our most
important data. Families save precious photos to secondary storage.
Students back up important homework assignments to secondary storage. And
when your cell phone runs out of secondary storage, you can no longer
download new apps or take photos or videos.
Secondary storage devices have always been an indispensable element in
any computer system. They have similarities to output and input devices.
Like output devices, secondary storage devices receive information from
the system unit in the form of the machine language of 0s and 1s. Rather
than translating the information, however, secondary storage devices save
the information in machine language for later use. Like input devices,
secondary storage devices send information to the system unit for
processing. However, the information, because it is already in machine
form, does not need to be translated. It is sent directly to memory (RAM),
where it can be accessed and processed by the CPU.
Understanding the uses and different types of secondary storage will
help you make smart decisions when purchasing a new cell phone or laptop,
help you to protect your data from disaster or theft, and improve the
usefulness of the devices you already own. You need to know the
capabilities, limitations, and uses of hard disks, solid-state drives,
optical discs, cloud storage, and other types of secondary storage.
Additionally, you need to be aware of specialty storage devices for
portable computers and to be knowledgeable about how large organizations
manage their extensive data resources.
Storage
reset page 422
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
An essential feature of every computer is the ability to
save, or store, information. As discussed in Chapter 5,
random-access memory (RAM) holds or stores data and programs
that the CPU is presently processing. Before data can be
processed or a program can be run, it must be in RAM. For
this reason, RAM is sometimes referred to as primary storage.
Unfortunately, most RAM provides only temporary or
volatile storage. That is, if the computer is turned off or
loses power due to a power failure, all the information
stored on RAM is erased. This volatility results in a need
for more permanent or nonvolatile storage for data and
programs. RAM also has the disadvantage of being relatively
small and unable to hold all the videos, photos, and
applications that we regularly use.
Secondary storage provides permanent or nonvolatile
storage with far larger capacity than RAM. Using secondary
storage devices such as a solid-state drive, data and
programs can be retained after the computer has been shut
off. This is accomplished by writing files to and reading
files from secondary storage devices. Writing is the process
of saving information to the secondary storage device.
Reading is the process of accessing information from
secondary storage. The most important characteristics of
secondary storage are:
Media are the physical material that holds the data and
programs.
Capacity measures how much a particular storage medium can
hold.
Storage devices are hardware that reads data and page 167
programs from storage media. These devices are
typically referred to as drives. Most also write to storage
media.
Access speed measures the amount of time required by the
storage device to retrieve data and programs.

What are four important characteristics of secondary storage?
Solid-State Storage
Solid-state storage devices provide access to flash memory,
commonly known as solid-state storage. As we discussed in
Chapter 5, flash memory offers a combination of features of
RAM and ROM. Like RAM, it can be updated, and like ROM it
does not lose information when a computer is turned off.
Flash memory is a little slower than traditional memory but
much faster than other secondary storage drives.
Solid-State Drives
reset page 424
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Solid-state drives (SSDs) store and retrieve data and
information much in the same manner as RAM. As we discussed
in Chapter 5, characters are represented by positive (+) and
negative (−) charges using the ASCII, EBCDIC, or Unicode
binary codes. For example, the letter A would require a
series of eight charges. (See Figure 7-2.)
Figure 7-2 Charges representing the letter A
SSDs are fast and durable and require little power, making
them popular for cell phones, tablets, and laptops. SSDs are
common on mobile devices and are gaining popularity on gaming
computers and desktops due to their speed and power
efficiency.
community
Criminals often target communities with malware and viruses by using
infected USB flash drives. These infected drives are handed out for
free at conventions, “accidentally” left behind at the library, or
simply dropped on the ground. When the victim finds the drive and plugs
it into their computer, the drive automatically installs malware and
viruses. Many believe you should never plug in an unknown USB drive.
Others suggest the risks are overblown. What do you think?
These drives can provide internal storage or be located
inside the system unit. (See Figure 7-3.) Or SSDs can provide
external storage.

Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices
widely used in portable devices. Some of the cards are used
within devices such as cell phones, laptops, and GPS
navigation systems. Other cards provide external or removable
storage. Flash memory cards are commonly used with digital
cameras and cell phones to expand their internal storage.

tips
Have you ever accidentally deleted or lost important files from
your flash drive? Do you have a USB flash drive that is no
longer being recognized by your computer? Here are a few
suggestions that might help:
1
Recovery/undelete software. If you accidentally deleted files
from a flash drive, it is unlikely that you can recover them using
your operating system or searching through your recycle bin.
Fortunately, there are several recovery (or undelete) programs
that might help, and some are even free. For example, two free
programs are Disk Drill and Recuva. These programs will scan your
flash drives for deleted files and offer you a chance to recover
the ones you want back.
2
Testing USB ports. If your computer does not recognize your USB
flash drive, there could be a problem with your USB port. Try
plugging another device into that same port to see if it works. If
this device does not work, then your computer’s USB is most
likely defective and needs to be replaced. If the device works,
then most likely your USB flash drive is damaged and you should
try the professional recovery services discussed in the next step.
3
Professional recovery services. For damaged flash drives, there
is a possibility that your data could be recovered by several
reset page 427
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
companies that are dedicated to data recovery. Although the fees
are high, they can rescue data from the actual memory chip, even
if the drive or supporting circuits are damaged.
USB Flash Drives
USB flash drives, or simply flash drives, are so compact
that they can be transported on a key ring. These small,
solid-state drives conveniently connect directly to a
computer’s USB port to transfer files and can have
capacities ranging from 1 GB to 2 TB and higher, with a broad
price range to match. (See Figure 7-5.) Due to their
convenient size and large capacities, flash drives have
become a very popular option for transporting data and
information among computers, specialty devices, and the
Internet.

Hard Disks
Unlike solid-state drives, which have no moving parts, hard-
disk drives rotate and have read/write heads that move in and
out. These moving parts allow hard-disk drives to use
inexpensive technology to provide large-capacity storage;
however, they also make hard disks less durable and slower
than solid-state drives.
Hard disks save files by altering the magnetic charges of
the disk’s surface to represent 1s and 0s. Hard disks
retrieve data and programs by reading these charges from the
magnetic disk. Density refers to how tightly these charges
can be packed next to one another on the disk.
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that are stacked
one on top of another. Hard disks store and organize files
using tracks, sectors, and cylinders. Tracks are rings of
concentric circles on the platter. Each track is divided into
invisible wedge-shaped sections called sectors. (See Figure
7-6.) A cylinder runs through each track of a stack of
platters. Cylinders are necessary to differentiate files
stored on the same track and sector of different platters.
When a hard disk is formatted, tracks, sectors, and cylinders
are assigned.
reset page 429
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Figure 7-6 Tracks and sectors
There are three basic types of hard disks: internal,
external, and network.
Internal Hard Disks
An internal hard disk is located inside the system unit.
These hard disks are able to store and retrieve large
quantities of information quickly. They are used to store
programs and data files. For example, nearly every personal
computer uses its internal hard disk to store its operating
system and major applications such as Word and Excel.
To ensure adequate performance of your internal hard disk
and the safety of your data, you should perform routine
maintenance and periodically make backup copies of all
important files.
External Hard Disks
Although internal hard disks provide fast access, they have a
fixed amount of storage and cannot be easily removed from the
system unit. External hard disks provide slower access and
reset page 430
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
are typically connected to a USB or Thunderbolt port on the
system unit and are easily removed. Like an internal hard
disk, external hard disks have a fixed amount of storage.
However, because each removable hard disk can be easily
replaced by another removable hard disk, a single port on the
system unit can provide access to an unlimited amount of
storage. (See Figure 7-7.)
Figure 7-7 External hard drive
TK 1980/Shutterstock
External hard drives use the same basic technology as
internal hard drives and are used primarily to complement an
internal hard disk. Because they are easily removed, they are
particularly useful to protect or secure sensitive
information. Other uses for external drives include backing
up the contents of the internal hard disk and providing
additional hard-disk capacity.
Network Drives
While internal and external hard-disk drives exist local to
the system unit, either within the system unit or nearby,
network drives place the drive or drives on a network and can
be located across the world from the system unit. This is a
popular solution for individuals and businesses where access
reset page 431
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
speed is not essential, but capacity and durability are
crucial.
page 170
Performance Enhancements
Four ways to improve the performance of hard disks are disk
caching, hybrid drives, redundant arrays of inexpensive
disks, and file compression/decompression.
Disk caching improves hard-disk performance by
anticipating data needs. It performs a function similar to
cache memory discussed in Chapter 5. While cache memory
improves processing by acting as a temporary high-speed
holding area between memory and the CPU, disk caching
improves processing by acting as a temporary high-speed
holding area between a secondary storage device and memory.
Disk caching requires a combination of hardware and software.
During idle processing time, frequently used data is
automatically identified and read from the hard disk into the
disk cache. When needed, the data is then accessed directly
from memory. The transfer rate from memory is much faster
than from the hard disk. As a result, overall system
performance is often increased by as much as 30 percent.
privacy
Diminishing secondary storage prices have an unexpected impact on
privacy. The availability of cheap digital storage has resulted in a
permanent digital record of our lives available for all to see on the
Internet. Once an image, video, or message is released on the Internet,
it is very difficult to remove. Some argue that we all have a “right
to be forgotten” and that major Internet companies like Instagram and
Google should help people permanently remove records of embarrassing or
unpleasant moments. Others say that the Internet is a record of our
past and we can’t choose to only hold on to the positive things. What
do you think?
reset page 432
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Hybrid drives are storage drives that contain both solid-
state storage and hard disks in an attempt to gain the speed
and power benefits of SSDs while still having the low cost
and large capacity of hard drives. Typically, these systems
use SSD to store the operating system and applications and
hard disks to store videos, music, and documents.
Redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) improve
performance by expanding external storage, improving access
speed, and providing reliable storage. Several inexpensive
hard-disk drives are connected to one another. These
connections can be by a network or within specialized RAID
devices. (See Figure 7-8.) The connected hard-disk drives are
related or grouped together, and the computer system
interacts with the RAID system as though it were a single
large-capacity hard-disk drive. The result is expanded
storage capability, fast access speed, and high reliability.
For these reasons, RAID is often used by Internet servers and
large organizations.
Figure 7-8 RAID storage device

File compression and file decompression increase storage
capacity by reducing the amount of space required to store
data and programs. File compression is not limited to hard-
disk systems. It is frequently used to compress files on
reset page 433
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
DVDs, CDs, and flash drives as well. File compression also
helps to speed up transmission of files from one computer
system to another. Sending and receiving compressed files
across the Internet is a common activity.
File compression programs scan files for ways to reduce
the amount of required storage. One way is to search for
repeating patterns. The repeating patterns are replaced with
a token, leaving enough tokens so that the original can be
rebuilt or decompressed. These programs often shrink files to
a quarter of their original size.
Windows and Mac operating systems provide compression and
decompression utilities. For more advanced compression
schemes, you can use specialized utilities such as WinZip.
For a summary of performance enhancement techniques, see
Figure 7-9.

List and describe four ways to improve the performance of hard disks.
Optical Discs
Optical discs can hold over 128 GB (gigabytes) of data. (See
Figure 7-10.) That is the equivalent of millions of
typewritten pages or a medium-sized library, all on a single
disc. Most software and many movies are available on optical
discs.
Figure 7-10 Optical disc
limpido/Shutterstock
In optical disc technology, a laser beam alters the
surface of a plastic or metallic disc to represent data.
Unlike hard disks, which use magnetic charges to represent 1s
and 0s, optical discs use reflected light. The 1s and 0s are
represented by flat areas called lands and bumpy areas called
pits on the disc surface. The disc is read by an optical disc
drive using a laser that projects a tiny beam of light on
reset page 435
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
these areas. The amount of reflected light determines whether
the area represents a 1 or a 0.
Like hard disks, optical discs use tracks and sectors to
organize and store files. Unlike the concentric tracks and
wedge-shaped sectors used for hard disks, however, optical
discs typically use a single track that spirals outward from
the center of the disc. This single track is divided into
equal-sized sectors.
The most widely used optical discs are CD, DVD, and Blu-
ray discs.
Compact discs (CDs) were the first widely available optical
format for PC users, but have largely been replaced by DVDs
and Blu-rays. Typically, CD drives store 700 MB (megabytes)
of storage. Optical discs that store music are often CDs.
Digital versatile discs (DVDs) are the standard optical
discs in PCs. DVDs are very similar to CDs except that
typical DVD discs can store 4.7 GB (gigabytes)—seven times
the capacity of CDs. Optical discs that store movies or
software are often DVDs. DVD drives and CD drives look very
similar.
Blu-ray discs (BDs) are the newest form of optical storage
designed to store hi-def (high-definition) video. The name
Blu-ray comes from a special blue-colored laser used to
read the discs that gives them a typical capacity of 50 GB
—10 times the capacity of DVDs. Optical discs that store
hi-def video and the newest video games are often Blu-ray
discs. The newest Blu-ray discs, Ultra HD Blu-rays (UHD
BD), are able to play back 4K video content and store up to
100 GB of data.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats: read
only, write once, and rewritable.
Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs are discs that
cannot be written on or erased by the user. Optical discs
reset page 436
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
that you buy in a store, such as music CDs, DVD movies, and
Blu-ray video games, are often read only.
Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be page 172
written on once. After that, the disc can be read
many times but cannot be written on or erased. These discs
are ideal for creating permanent archives, such as CD-R,
often used for storing family photos, and DVD-R, often used
to store home movies.
Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random-access
memory) discs are similar to write-once discs except that
the disc surface is not permanently altered when data is
recorded. These changeable, portable storage options are
popular for storing and sharing audio, video, and large
multimedia presentations.
tips
Today’s cloud services allow your cell phone to access
important files from anywhere; however, it can use a lot of
data. Going over your cell phone plan’s data limits can be
expensive and frustrating. Even if you have an unlimited data
plan, if you are a heavy Internet user, your service provider
may slow your Internet connection. If you’d like to reduce
your data usage, consider the following suggestions.
1
Monitor your data usage. Find out what apps are using the most
data by checking your operating system’s data usage statistics.
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen, then choose Wireless & Networks and then Data
Usage. You may need to scroll down to see how much data each
app is using.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and tap on Cellular. You may need to scroll down to see
how much data each app is using.
2
Limit background data use. Many apps will use your data plan
even when the app is not open. Your mobile OS can limit which apps
can use your data in the background.
reset page 437
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
For Android cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the
home screen, then choose Data Usage and then tap Data Saver.
This will automatically block all apps from downloading data
while active. Finally, select Unrestricted data access and
select any apps you want to allow to use background data.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the Settings icon from the Home
screen and choose General and then Background App Refresh. This
lists your apps, and you can select which can use background
data and which cannot.
Some optical discs, referred to as double-sided discs,
contain information on both sides of the disc and need to be
flipped over to read the other side, effectively doubling the
storage capacity of the disk. For example, a double-sided DVD
can store 9.4 GB, or twice as much as a single-sided DVD.
Another way to add capacity to an optical disc is by adding
multiple recording layers. These discs store information on
several layers sandwiched together on one side of the disc.
For example, some Blu-ray discs have multiple layers that
increase storage capacity from 25 GB to 128 GB.
For a summary of the different types of optical discs, see
Figure 7-11.

Cloud Storage
Recently, many applications that would have required
installation on your computer to run have moved to the web.
As we discussed in Chapter 2, this is known as cloud
computing, where the Internet acts as a “cloud” of servers
that supply applications to clients as a service rather than
a product. Additionally, these servers provide cloud storage,
also known as online storage.
page 173
If you have used Google Drive Docs to create a word
processing document or a spreadsheet, you have already used
cloud computing. (See Figure 7-12.) The service provider’s
server runs the applications, and your computer displays
results. The applications and data can be accessed from any
Internet-ready device. This means that even devices with
little storage, memory, or processing power, such as a cell
phone, can run the same powerful applications as a desktop
computer.

ethics
Cloud storage has created some interesting legal and ethical questions
regarding the storage of sensitive and privileged information. Who is
responsible for maintaining security and privacy of sensitive and
confidential information? What if your attorney or doctor stored
confidential information about you in the cloud and it somehow became
widely distributed across the Internet? Clearly, you suffer any related
consequences, but who is responsible? Is it your attorney, your doctor,
the company providing the cloud service, or do you somehow have the
responsibility to protect personal sensitive information?
The benefits to this arrangement are numerous:
Maintenance—The cloud service will take care of backups,
encryption, and security.
reset page 440
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Hardware upgrades—The cloud service will never run out of
disk space and can replace failed hard disks without
interruption to the user.
File syncing and collaboration—Users can share documents,
spreadsheets, and files with others from anywhere with an
Internet connection. One user can sync files across
multiple devices, and all users will have the most recent
version of their documents.
Of course, there are some disadvantages of cloud storage:
Access speed—The data transfer rate is dependent upon the
speed of your Internet connection, which most likely is not
as fast as a user’s internal network.
File security—Users are dependent upon the cloud
service’s security procedures, which may not be as
effective as your own.
Numerous websites provide cloud storage services. (See
Figure 7-13.) To learn more about how you could use cloud
storage, see Making IT Work for You: Cloud Storage on pages

Making IT work for you
CLOUD STORAGE
Do you find that you take a lot of photos and videos on
your phone, and your storage space is running low? Are you
working on a group project and finding it difficult to
keep everyone updated with the most recent version of
documents and files? Are you looking for a safe, secure
location to store backups and important files? If so,
cloud storage may be the solution you are looking for.
Here are some things to consider when choosing a cloud
storage option.
What will you store?
The types of files that you store can have a big impact on
determining the best cloud storage service for you. The following
suggests the best file service for you based on the types of files
you typically store.
If you primarily store photos, then consider the cloud services
of Flickr and Adobe Creative Cloud. They feature online tools to
edit, share, and search photos.
If you primarily store music, then consider the cloud services
of Google Play Music and iTunes Match. They feature online tools
to listen to music and create customizable playlists.
reset page 442
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If you primarily store documents, then consider the cloud
services Adobe Document Cloud and Microsoft’s One Drive. They
feature online tools to view and edit documents.
If you primarily need storage to back up your system programs,
consider the cloud services of Backblaze and iDrive. They have
apps that back up your devices’ data, making backups seamless
and easy.
Also, what you store will impact how much storage you need.
If you are only looking to store documents and text files, you
will not need much storage space; however, videos and photo
albums can take up a lot more storage. Different services offer
different pricing plans and have special offers depending on
what types of files you store—the best cloud storage plan for
you will tailor itself to your storage needs.

photos.

What tools will you use?
If your storage needs are mostly sharing and working on documents,
your best cloud storage choice may be determined by the software
you use to create those documents. Most office software page 175
suites are designed to work seamlessly with specific
cloud storage services. Examples of popular office suites and
their corresponding cloud services include:
If you primarily use Microsoft Office applications, then
consider Microsoft OneDrive cloud service.
If you primarily use Google Docs, then consider Google Drive
cloud service.
reset page 443
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
If you primarily use Apple iWork applications, then consider
Apple iCloud cloud service.

What hardware do you have?
Your hardware choices can influence your best cloud storage
option. Apple’s iCloud works best on Apple devices. Chromebooks
and Android phones are designed around using Google Drive, and
Windows PCs have OneDrive designed into the operating system.
Also, not just the manufacturer of your device, but the type of
device can impact your choice as well. For example, if you do most
of your computing on a mobile device, Google Drive has apps and
tools that are designed to work with touch screens and mobile
Internet connections. However, if you spend most of your time
offline, you may find that Google Drive is not as robust as other
cloud storage options.
How do you want to share?
One of the best features of cloud storage is the ease of sharing
files. Consider who you share with and what you want to share
before choosing a cloud storage provider. For example, if you are
working on a group project at school, and the school uses
Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft OneDrive might be the easiest
solution. If you share files at work, but only want the recipient
to be able to read but not write to a file, you may need the more
robust security features found in a service like box.com. Sharing
photos and videos on Google and Dropbox is easy if the recipient
has a Google or Dropbox account; otherwise, it might take a little
more effort.
reset page 444
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Also, consider the technical knowledge of the people you share
with. Some cloud services are designed to be used by businesses
with complex security and backup features. Such features would be
valuable to a company of trained professionals sharing sensitive
documents, but for many less technical people, it is an
unnecessary complication that makes sharing photos and files more
difficult. Apple’s iCloud makes organizing and sharing photos
simple for a typical iPhone user, but that simplicity might be too
limiting for a professional photographer. Facebook may store your
low-resolution photos for free, but if you want to share a photo,
the recipient must sign up for Facebook.
Microsoft OneDrive works well on Windows OS and with Microsoft Office
products.

There are many options in the cloud storage market—finding the right one
for you will require understanding how you want to use cloud storage.
Recognizing the features and limitations of each service is a start to
finding the right place for your family photos or last year’s tax
records. Finally, most services offer a free trial before purchasing or
committing fully—try out a service with different files, on different
devices, and sharing with different people to find out which is best for
you.

Mass Storage Devices
It is natural to think of secondary storage media and devices
as they relate to us as individuals. It may not be as obvious
how important these matters are to organizations. Mass
storage refers to the tremendous amount of secondary storage
required by large organizations.
Mass storage devices are specialized high-capacity
secondary storage devices designed to meet organizational
demands for data storage. These mass storage solutions allow
large corporations and institutions to centralize their
maintenance and security of data, thereby reducing costs and
personnel.
Enterprise Storage System
Most large organizations have established a strategy called
an enterprise storage system to promote efficient and safe
use of data across the networks within their organizations.
(See Figure 7-14.) Some of the mass storage devices that
support this strategy are as follows:
File servers—dedicated computers with very large storage
capacities that provide users access to fast storage and
retrieval of data.
Network attached storage (NAS)—a type of file server
designed for homes and small businesses. NAS is less
expensive, easier to set up, and easier to manage than most
file servers. However, it does not include powerful
management tools and features found in many large-scale
file servers.
RAID systems—larger versions of the specialized page 177
devices discussed earlier in this chapter that
protect data by constantly making backup copies of files
moving across the organization’s networks.

facilities contain banks of file servers to offer enormous
amounts of storage.

Storage Area Network
An innovative and growing mass storage technology is storage
area network (SAN) systems. SAN is an architecture to link
remote computer storage devices, such as enterprise storage
systems, to computers such that the devices are as available
as locally attached drives. In a SAN system, the user’s
computer provides the file system for storing data, but the
SAN provides the disk space for data.
The key to a SAN is a high-speed network, connecting
individual computers to mass storage devices. Special file
systems prevent simultaneous users from interfering with each
other. SANs provide the ability to house data in remote
locations and still allow efficient and secure access.

Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for
recovering systems and data after a disaster strikes an
organization. In addition, they often create plans to
prevent and prepare for such disasters. A crucial part of
that plan is to use storage devices and media in order to
ensure that all company data is backed up and, in some
cases, stored off-site.
Employers typically look for candidates with a
bachelor’s or associate’s degree in information systems
or computer science. Experience in this field is usually
required, and additional skills in the areas of networking,
security, and database administration are desirable.
Disaster recovery specialists should possess good
communication skills and be able to handle high-stress
situations.
Disaster recovery specialists can expect to earn an
annual salary of $70,500 to $87,000. Opportunities for
advancement typically include upper-management positions.
With so many types of threats facing organizations, demand
for these types of specialists is expected to grow.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Next-Generation Storage
Every year, cell phones improve. One of their greatest features is the
incredible cameras we can now carry in our pockets. As we record longer
videos at greater quality, we need more secondary storage to hold them.
Scientists are looking to a future where you may carry years, worth of
videos or walk around with an entire copy of the Internet in your pocket
and where every moment of your day will be recorded in vastly larger
secondary storage devices than the ones we have today. Such future storage
will require new ways of thinking and astounding technological
advancements that are currently being studied. In the future, your cell
phone may record data using heat rays, lasers, or even DNA.
Our cell phones, tablets, and laptops have secondary storage that uses
magnets to store information. A magnetic field writes data on the surface
of a magnetized material by flipping a magnetic charge on the surface of
the material. The retained magnetic charge on the surface represents one
bit of information. The magnetic charge on the surface must be kept far
apart from the other bits of information stored elsewhere on the surface.
If the two bits are stored too closely together, the magnetic field of one
bit could overwrite the data in the other bit. This is one of the major
limitations to how much space is required to store information digitally.

To overcome this limitation, scientists are exploring the use of
Samsung’s Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) technologies. A HAMR
writes data on a special heat-sensitive magnetic surface. The surface can
reset page 450
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
be written on with a magnetic field—but only when the surface is heated.
When not heated, the surface will not change. Thus, closely packed bits of
information will not overwrite each other as long as the material is not
heated. Writing to the surface is accomplished by preheating an area using
a precision laser. If this technology can be brought to market, a hard
disk could store 50 times more information.
While HAMR technology may allow us to store more information in every
square inch of a magnetic surface, Intel’s Optane flash memory is
exploring the possibility of storing data not on the surface but in 3D
multilevel cells (MLCs). Optane uses flash memory technologies to create
nonvolatile memory stacks that store information both horizontally and
vertically. These dense stacks of bits can be accessed much faster than
traditional flash memory—at speeds rivaling RAM access speeds.
The greatest innovations in secondary storage will likely require a
major change in the way we store data. Many of the most promising and
futuristic secondary storage devices do not use magnets to store
information. In nature, living creatures store genetic information on
strands of sequenced cells, called DNA. In 2017, Columbia University used
encoding techniques developed at Netflix to store 215 petabytes in one
gram of DNA. In 2019, researchers at the University of Washington
automated the read and write processes used to record data on DNA—
bringing the possibility of DNA secondary storage even closer.
Obviously, the technology to read and write DNA data is neither cheap
nor common, but when it comes to storing data, nature has been doing it
longer and better than we have. Perhaps in the future your family photos
won’t be stored on DVDs, but instead on genetic material. Do you think
that the expenses associated with DNA processing will ever reduce enough
to make DNA data storage useful, or will we continue with hard drives and
flash memory?

RAM is primary storage. Most RAM is volatile, meaning
that it loses its contents whenever power is disrupted.
Secondary storage provides nonvolatile storage.
Secondary storage retains data and information after the
computer system is turned off.
Writing is the process of saving information to
secondary storage devices (drives). Reading is the
process of accessing information.
Important characteristics include the following:
Media—actual physical material that retains data and
programs.
Capacity—how much a particular storage medium can
hold.
Storage devices—hardware that reads and writes to
storage media.
Access speed—time required to retrieve data from a
secondary storage device.
SOLID-STATE STORAGE
reset page 452
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Pheelings media/Shutterstock
Solid-state storage devices provide access to flash
memory, also know as solid-state storage. Flash memory
is slower than traditional memory but faster than other
secondary storage drives. Solid-state storage devices
have no moving parts and provide access to flash memory
(solid-state storage).
Solid-State Drives
Solid-state drives (SSDs) work much like RAM. They are
fast and durable, require little power, are relatively
expensive, and are lower in capacity than other secondary
storage drives. SSDs can provide internal storage or can
be located outside the system unit.
Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices
that are widely used with portable devices including
digital cameras, cell phones, and navigation systems.
USB Flash Drives
USB flash drives (flash drives) are so small that they
fit onto a key ring. These drives connect to a
reset page 453
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computer’s USB port and are widely used to transfer data
and information between computers, specialty devices, and
the Internet.
page 180
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of the different types of secondary
storage. You need to know their capabilities,
limitations, and uses. There are four widely used
storage media: hard disk, solid state, optical disc,
and cloud storage.
HARD DISKS
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that provide a
large amount of capacity. They store data and programs by
altering the electromagnetic charges on the platter’s
surface. Files are organized according to
reset page 454
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Tracks—concentric rings on the platter.
Sectors—wedge-shaped sections.
Cylinders—run through each track of a stack of
platters.
Density refers to how tightly electromagnetic charges
can be packed next to one another on the disk.
Internal Hard Disks
Internal hard disks are located within the system unit.
They are used to store programs and data files.
External Hard Disks
External hard-disk drives connect to a port on the system
unit, are not as fast as internal drives, and are
removable, providing unlimited storage using a single
port.
HARD DISKS

Network Drives
Network drives are located on a network anywhere in the
world.
reset page 455
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Performance Enhancements
Four ways to improve hard-disk performance are disk
caching, hybrid drives, RAID, and file compression and
decompression.
Disk caching—provides a temporary high-speed holding
area between a secondary storage device and the CPU;
improves performance by anticipating data needs and
reducing time to access data from secondary storage.
Hybrid drives—contain both solid-state storage and
hard disks in an attempt to gain the speed and power
benefits of SSDs while still having the low cost and
large capacity of hard drives.
RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks)—several
inexpensive hard-disk drives are connected together;
improves performance by providing expanded storage,
fast access, and high reliability.
File compression and decompression—files are
compressed before storing and then decompressed before
being used again; improves performance through
efficient storage.

Optical discs use laser technology. 1s and 0s are
represented by pits and lands. Optical disc drives
project light and measure the reflected light.
The most widely used optical discs are the following:
Compact discs (CDs) were the first; typical storage
700 MB; often used to store music.
Digital versatile discs (DVDs) are standard optical
discs; typical storage 4.7 GB; often used to store
movies and software.
Blu-ray discs (BDs) are designed to store hi-def
(high-definition) video; typical storage 50 GB; often
used to store hi-def video and video games; Ultra HD
Blu-rays (UHD BD) are the newest and able to use 4K
video content and store up to 100 GB of data.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats:
Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs cannot be
written on or erased by the user.
Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be written on
once. After that, they can be read many times but
cannot be written on or erased.
reset page 457
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random-
access memory) discs are similar to write-once discs
except that the disc surface is not permanently altered
when data is recorded.
CLOUD STORAGE

With cloud computing, the Internet acts as a “cloud”
of servers. Cloud storage (online storage) is supplied
by these servers.
Cloud servers provide storage, processing, and memory.
Advantages for users include less maintenance, fewer
hardware upgrades, and easy file sharing and
collaboration.
Disadvantages for users include slower access speed and
less control over file security.
MASS STORAGE DEVICES

storage devices are specialized high-capacity secondary
storage devices.
Most large organizations have established a strategy
called an enterprise storage system to promote efficient
and safe use of data.
Mass storage devices that support this strategy are
file servers, network attached storage (NAS), RAID
systems, and organizational cloud storage. A storage

remote storage systems as if they were local to your
computer.
