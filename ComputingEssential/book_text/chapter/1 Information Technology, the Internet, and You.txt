The purpose of this book is to help you become a highly efficient and
effective computer user. This includes how to use (1) apps and application
software; (2) all types of computer hardware, including mobile devices
like smartphones, tablets, and laptops; and (3) the Internet. Becoming a
highly efficient and effective computer user also requires a full
understanding of the potential impact of technology on privacy and the
environment as well as the role of personal and organizational ethics.
To effectively and efficiently use computers, you need to know the
parts of an information system: people, procedures, software, hardware,
data, and the Internet. You also need to understand the wireless
revolution, the mobile Internet, and the web and to recognize the role of
information technology in your personal and professional life.
Information Systems
When you think of a personal computer, perhaps you think of
just the equipment itself. That is, you think of the screen
or the keyboard. Yet there is more to it than that. The way
to think about a personal computer is as part of an
information system. An information system has several parts:
people, procedures, software, hardware, data, and the
Internet. (See Figure 1-1.)
People: It is easy to overlook people as one of the parts
of an information system. Yet this is what personal
computers are all about—making people, end users like you,
more productive.
reset page 57
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Procedures: The rules or guidelines for people to follow
when using software, hardware, and data are procedures.
These procedures are typically documented in manuals
written by computer specialists. Software and hardware
manufacturers provide manuals with their products. These
manuals are provided in either printed or electronic form.
Software: A program consists of the step-by-step
instructions that tell the computer how to do its work.
Software is another name for a program or programs. The
purpose of software is to convert data (unprocessed facts)
into information (processed facts). For example, a payroll
program would instruct the computer to take the number of
hours you worked in a week (data) and multiply it by your
pay rate (data) to determine how much you are paid for the
week (information).
Hardware: The equipment that processes the data to create
information is called hardware. It includes smartphones,
tablets, keyboards, mice, displays, system units, and other
devices. Hardware is controlled by software.
Data: The raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers,
images, and sounds, are called data. Processed data yields
information. Using the previous example of a payroll
program, the data (number of hours worked and pay rate) is
processed (multiplied) to yield information (weekly pay).
Internet: Almost all information systems provide a way to
connect to other people and computers, typically using the
Internet. This connectivity greatly expands the capability
and usefulness of information systems.

People
People are surely the most important part of any information
system. Our lives are touched every day by computers and
information systems. Many times the contact is direct and
obvious, such as when we create documents using a word
processing program or when we connect to the Internet. (See
Figure 1-2.) Other times, the contact is not as obvious.

Community
Every major technology has affected communities—but none in the unique
ways that computers have. We have changed how we interact with our
communities, both in the tools we use to communicate, such as social
media posts, and in the ways we communicate, in emojis and podcasts.
But technology has had a deeper impact on our communities than just the
way we interact. It has forever changed how we find and identify our
communities. Every day, people meet, discuss, and bond with others they
have never met in person. The entire world feels a little smaller, with
our communities extending around the globe.
Throughout this book you will find a variety of features
designed to help you become an efficient and effective end
user. These features include Making IT Work for You, Tips,
Privacy, Community, Ethics, and Careers in IT.
Making IT Work for You. Throughout this book you will find
Making IT Work for You features that present numerous
interesting and practical IT applications. For just a few

Tips. We all can benefit from a few tips or suggestions.
Throughout this book you will find numerous tips to make
your computing safer, more efficient, and more effective.
These tips range from the basics of keeping your computer
system running smoothly to how to protect your page 7
privacy while surfing the web. For a partial list of
the tips presented in the following chapters, see Figure 1-
4.
Privacy. One of the most critical issues today is how to
protect the privacy of our personal information. Throughout
this book you will find Privacy boxes in the margin that
present information about protecting our privacy.
Community. Computers are changing the way we define and
interact with our communities. In this chapter and the
following ones, you will find Community boxes in the
margins that present ways in which technology affects how
we create and engage with our communities.
Ethics. Most people agree that we should behave ethically.
That is, we should follow a system of moral principles that
direct our everyday lives. However, for any given
circumstance, people often do not agree on the ethics of
the situation. Throughout this book you will find numerous
Ethics boxes posing a variety of different
ethical/unethical situations for your consideration.
Careers in IT. One of the most important decisions of your
life is to decide upon your life’s work or career. Perhaps
you are planning to be a writer, an artist, or an engineer.
Or you might become a professional in information
technology (IT). Each of the following chapters highlights
a specific career in information technology. This feature
provides job descriptions, projected employment demands,
educational requirements, current salary ranges, and

Software
Software, as we mentioned, is another name for programs.
Programs are the instructions that tell the computer how to
process data into the form you want. In most cases, the words
software and programs are interchangeable. There are two
major kinds of software: system software and application
software. You can think of application software as the kind
you use. Think of system software as the kind the computer
uses.
System Software
The user interacts primarily with application software.
System software enables the application software to interact
with the computer hardware. System software is “background”
software that helps the computer manage its own internal
resources.

System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a
collection of programs, including the following:
Operating systems are programs that coordinate computer
resources, provide an interface between users and the
computer, and run applications. Smartphones, tablets, and
many other mobile devices use embedded operating systems,
also known as real-time operating systems (RTOS). Desktop
computers use stand-alone operating systems like Windows
reset page 65
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
10 or macOS. (See Figures 1-5 and 1-6.) Networks use
network operating systems (NOS).
Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing
computer resources. One of the most essential utility
programs that every computer system should have is an
antivirus program. These programs protect your computer
system from viruses or malicious programs that are all too
often deposited onto your computer from the Internet. These
programs can damage software and hardware, as well as
compromise the security and privacy of your personal data.
If your computer does not have an antivirus program
installed on it, you need to get one. To see how you can
install a free antivirus program on your computer, see
Making IT Work for You: Free Antivirus Program on page 9.
Application Software
Application software might be described as end-user
software. Three types of application software are general-
purpose, specialized, and apps.
General-purpose applications are widely used in nearly
all career areas. They are the kinds of programs you have to
know to be considered an efficient and effective end user.
Some of the best known are presented in Figure 1-7.
Specialized applications include thousands of other
programs that are more narrowly focused on specific
disciplines and occupations. Two of the best known are
graphics and web authoring programs.
Mobile apps, also known as mobile applications or simply
apps, are small programs primarily designed for mobile
devices such as smartphones and for tablets. There are over 5
million apps. The most popular mobile apps are for social
networking, playing games, and downloading music and videos.

FREE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM
Have you or someone you know had a slower computing
experience due to a spyware infection? Even worse, perhaps
a malicious piece of software stole crucial, personal
information or caused a total system failure. Most of
these problems can be averted by having an up-to-date
antivirus program running in your computer’s memory at
all times. This exercise shows you how to download and
install a free antivirus program if your computer does not
yet have one. (Please note that the web is continually
changing, and some of the specifics presented here may
have changed.)
Getting Started First, make sure your computer does not have an
antivirus or security suite running. If it does, be sure to completely
uninstall that program, even if the subscription is expired. Now, follow
these steps to install AVG, a popular, free antivirus program:
reset page 67
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Visit http://free.avg.com and click the Download button.
You will be asked to click “save” to save the
installation file to your computer.
Run the installation file and follow the prompts.
Select Install Basic to install the antivirus software.
Once the program is installed, it will open automatically.
Using AVG Generally speaking, your antivirus program watches your
system for malware and updates itself automatically. However, you can
always download updates manually, set a schedule for full-system scans,
and change basic settings for various components of the software.
Click Scan now to run a full scan on your computer.
Just to the right of that, click the button with the white
cog to see the scan options, where you can set a schedule
for automated scans.
Click the back arrow to reach the main screen, where you
can click various elements of the program to configure
them. For example, clicking Web will allow you to turn on a
feature that detects cookies that may be used to track your
online activity.

Hardware
Computers are electronic devices that can follow instructions
to accept input, process that input, and produce information.
This book focuses principally on personal computers. However,
it is almost certain that you will come in contact, at least
indirectly, with other types of computers.
Types of Computers
There are four types of computers: supercomputers, mainframe
computers, midrange computers, and personal computers.
Supercomputers are the most powerful type of computer.
These machines are special, high-capacity computers used by
very large organizations. Supercomputers are typically used
to process massive amounts of data. For example, they are
used to analyze and predict worldwide weather patterns.
IBM’s Blue Gene supercomputer is one of the fastest
computers in the world. (See Figure 1-8.)
Mainframe computers occupy specially wired, air-
conditioned rooms. Although not nearly as powerful as
supercomputers, mainframe computers are capable of great
reset page 69
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
processing speeds and data storage. For example, insurance
companies use mainframes to process information about
millions of policyholders.
Midrange computers, also referred to as servers, are
computers with processing capabilities less powerful than a
mainframe computer yet more powerful than a personal
computer. Originally used by medium-size companies or
departments of large companies to support their processing
needs, today midrange computers are most widely used to
support or serve end users for such specific needs as
retrieving data from a database or supplying access to
application software.
Personal computers, also known as PCs, are the page 11
least powerful, yet the most widely used and
fastest-growing type of computer. There are five types of
personal computers: desktops, laptops, tablets,
smartphones, and wearables. Desktop computers are small
enough to fit on top of or alongside a desk yet are too big
to carry around. (See Figure 1-9.) Laptop computers, also
known as notebook computers, are portable and lightweight
and fit into most briefcases. (See Figure 1-10.) Tablets,
also known as tablet computers, are smaller, lighter, and
generally less powerful than laptops. Like a laptop,
tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a
standard keyboard. (See Figure 1-11.) Instead, tablets
typically use a virtual keyboard that appears on the screen
and is touch-sensitive.
Smartphones are the most widely used personal computer.
Smartphones are cell phones with wireless connections to
the Internet and processing capabilities. (See Figure 1-
12.) Other mobile computers include wearable devices like
Apple’s Watch. (See Figure 1-13.)

Cell Phones
Many people are not aware that their cell phone is a
computer, and this computer has many of the same components
as desktops, laptops, and tablets. At one time, cell phones
had very limited power and were used almost exclusively for
making telephone calls. Now, almost all cell phones are
powerful smartphones capable of connecting to the Internet
and running any number of apps. In fact, nearly every cell
phone purchased today is more powerful than the computers
used to land the first person on the moon.
Today, over 99 percent of Americans under the age of 30
own a cell phone, and over 96 percent of those cell phones
are smartphones. As a result, the two terms are becoming
interchangeable. Reflecting this trend, we will use the terms
cell phone and smartphone interchangeably.
Personal Computer Hardware
Hardware for a personal computer system consists of a variety
of different devices. This physical equipment falls into four
basic categories: system unit, input/output, secondary
storage, and communication. Because we discuss hardware in
detail later in this book, here we will present just a quick
overview of the four basic categories.
System unit: The system unit is a container that houses
most of the electronic components that make up a computer
system. Two important components of the system unit are
reset page 73
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
microprocessors and memory. (See Figure 1-14.) The
microprocessor controls and manipulates data to produce
information. Memory is a holding area for data, page 12
instructions, and information. One type, random-
access memory (RAM), holds the program and data that are
currently being processed. This type of memory is sometimes
referred to as temporary storage because its contents will
typically be lost if the electric power to the computer is
disrupted.
Input/output: Input devices translate data and programs
that humans can understand into a form that the computer
can process. The most common input devices are the keyboard
and the mouse. Output devices translate the processed
information from the computer into a form that humans can
understand. The most common output device is the display,
also known as a monitor.
Secondary storage: Unlike memory, secondary storage holds
data and programs even after electric power to the computer
system has been turned off. The most important kinds of
secondary media are hard disks, solid-state storage, and
optical discs.
Hard disks are typically used to store programs and very
large data files. Using rigid metallic platters and
read/write heads that move across the platters, data and
information are stored using magnetic charges on the
disk’s surface. In contrast, solid-state storage does not
have any moving parts, is more reliable, and requires less
power. It saves data and information electronically similar
to RAM except that it is not volatile. (See Figure 1-15.)
Optical discs use laser technology to store data and
programs. Three types of optical discs are compact discs
(CDs), digital versatile (or video) discs (DVDs), and Blu-
ray discs (BD).
Communication: At one time, it was uncommon for a personal
computer system to communicate with other computer systems.
reset page 74
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Now, using communication devices, a personal computer
routinely communicates with other computer systems located
as near as the next office or as far away as halfway around
the world, using the Internet. A modem is a widely used
communication device that modifies audio, video, and other
types of data into a form that can be transmitted across
the Internet.

Data
Data is raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers,
images, and sounds. As we mentioned earlier, processed data
becomes information. When stored electronically in files,
data can be used directly as input for the system unit.
Four common types of files (see Figure 1-16) are
Document files, created by word processors to save
documents such as memos, term papers, and letters.
Worksheet files, created by electronic spreadsheets page 14
to analyze things like budgets and to predict
sales.
Database files, typically created by database management
programs to contain highly structured and organized data.
For example, an employee database file might contain all
the workers’ names, Social Security numbers, job titles,
and other related pieces of information.
Presentation files, created by presentation software to
save presentation materials. For example, a file might
contain audience handouts, speaker notes, and electronic
slides.

Connectivity and the Mobile
Internet
Connectivity is the capability of your personal computer to
share information with other computers. Central to the
concept of connectivity is the network. A network is a
reset page 77
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
communications system connecting two or more computers. The
largest network in the world is the Internet. It is like a
giant highway that connects you to millions of other people
and organizations located throughout the world. The web
provides a multimedia interface to the numerous resources
available on the Internet.
The Internet has driven the evolution of computers and
their impact on our daily lives. The rate of technological
change is accelerating at an ever faster pace. Along with the
Internet, three things that are driving the impact of
technology on our lives are cloud computing, wireless
communication, and the Internet of Things.
Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift many
computer activities from a user’s computer to computers on
the Internet. Rather than relying solely on their computer,
users can now use the Internet to connect to the cloud and
access more powerful computers, software, and storage.
Wireless communication has changed the way we communicate
with one another. The rapid development and widespread use
of wireless communication devices like tablets, cell
phones, and wearable devices have led many experts to
predict that wireless applications are just the beginning
of the wireless revolution, a revolution that will page 15
dramatically affect the way we communicate and use
computer technology.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing development
of the Internet that allows everyday objects embedded with
electronic devices to send and receive data over the
Internet. It promises to connect all types of devices, from
computers to cell phones, to watches, to any number of
everyday devices.
Wireless communication, cloud computing, and IoT are
driving the mobile Internet. They promise to continue to
dramatically affect the entire computer industry and how you

Powerful Software
The software that is now available can do an extraordinary number of tasks
and help you in an endless number of ways. You can create professional-
looking documents, analyze massive amounts of data, create dynamic
multimedia web pages, and much more. Today’s employers are expecting the
people they hire to be able to effectively and efficiently use a variety
of different types of software. General-purpose, specialized, and mobile
applications are presented in Chapter 3. System software is presented in
Chapter 4.
Powerful Hardware
Personal computers are now much more powerful than they used to be. Cell
phones, tablets, and communication technologies such as wireless networks
are dramatically changing the ways to connect to other computers,
networks, and the Internet. However, despite the rapid change of specific
equipment, their essential features remain unchanged. To become an
efficient and effective end user, you should focus on these features.
Chapters 5 through 8 explain what you need to know about hardware. For
those considering the purchase of a computer, an appendix—The Computer
Buyer’s Guide—is provided at the end of this book. This guide provides a
very concise comparison of desktops, laptops, tablets, and cell phones.
Privacy, Security, and Ethics
What about people? Experts agree that we as a society must be careful
about the potential of technology to negatively affect our lives.
Specifically, we need to be aware of how technology can affect our
personal privacy and our environment. Also, we need to understand the role
and the importance of organizational and personal ethics. These critical
reset page 82
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
issues are integrated in every chapter of this book as well as extensively
covered in Chapter 9.
Organizations
Almost all organizations rely on the quality and flexibility of their
information systems to stay competitive. As a member or employee of an
organization, you will undoubtedly be involved in these information
systems. In order to use, develop, modify, and maintain these systems, you
need to understand the basic concepts of information systems and know how
to safely, efficiently, and effectively use computers. These concepts are
covered throughout this book.
Changing Times
Are the times changing any faster now than they ever have? Almost everyone
thinks so. Whatever the answer, it is clear we live in a fast-paced age.
The Evolution of the Computer Age section presented at the end of this
book tracks the major developments since computers were first introduced.
After reading this book, you will be in a very favorable position
compared with many other people in industry today. You will learn not only
the basics of hardware, software, connectivity, the Internet, and the web,
but also the most current technology. You will be able to use these tools
to your advantage.

several parts of an information system:
People are an essential part of the system. The
purpose of information systems is to make people, or
end users like you, more productive.
Procedures are rules or guidelines to follow when
using software, hardware, and data. They are typically
documented in manuals written by computer
professionals.
Software (programs) provides step-by-step instructions
to control the computer to convert data into
information.
Hardware consists of the physical equipment. It is
controlled by software and processes data to create
information.
Data consists of unprocessed facts, including text,
numbers, images, and sound. Information is data that
has been processed by the computer.
The Internet allows computers to connect and share
information.

System Software
System software enables application software to interact
with computer hardware.
Operating systems coordinate resources, provide an
interface, and run applications. Three types are
embedded (real-time, RTOS), stand-alone, and network
(NOS).
Utilities perform specific tasks to manage computer
resources.
Application Software
Application software includes general-purpose,
specialized, and mobile applications.
General purpose—widely used in nearly all career
areas; programs include browsers, word processors,
spreadsheets, database management systems, and
presentation software.
Specialized—focus more on specific disciplines and
occupations; programs include graphics and web
authoring.
Apps (mobile apps, mobile applications)—designed for
mobile devices; most popular are for text messaging,
Internet browsing, and connecting to social networks.
HARDWARE

Hardware consists of electronic devices that can follow
instructions to accept input, process the input, and
produce information.
Types of Computers
Supercomputer, mainframe, midrange (server), and
personal computers (PCs) are four types of computers. A
personal computer can be a desktop, laptop (notebook
computer), tablet, smartphone, or a wearable.
Cell Phones
Today, almost all cell phones are smartphones; cell phone
and smartphone are becoming interchangeable terms.
Personal Computer Hardware
There are four basic categories of hardware devices:
System unit contains electronic circuitry, including
microprocessors and memory. Random-access memory
(RAM) holds the program and data currently being
processed.
Input/output devices are translators between humans
and computers. Input devices include the keyboard and
reset page 88
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
mouse. The most common output device is the computer
display (monitor).
Secondary storage holds data and programs. Typical
media include hard disks, solid-state storage, and
optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray).
Communication devices allow personal computers to
communicate with other computer systems. Modems modify
audio, video, and other types of data for transmission
across the Internet.

CONNECTIVITY AND THE MOBILE INTERNET
reset page 90
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Connectivity describes the ability of end users to use
resources well beyond their desktops. Central to the
concept of connectivity is the network or communication
system connecting two or more computers. The Internet is
the world’s largest computer network. The web provides
a multimedia interface to resources available on the
Internet.
Along with the Internet, three other things are
driving the impact of technology:
Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift
many computer activities from a user’s computer to
computers on the Internet.
Wireless revolution has changed the way we communicate
and use computer technology. Wireless devices include
tablets, cell phones, and watches.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing
development of the Internet that allows everyday
objects embedded with electronic devices to send and
receive data over the Internet.
