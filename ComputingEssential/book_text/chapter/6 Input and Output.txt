Why should I read this chapter?
Input and output devices have seen staggering advances in recent years. A
typical cell phone now has dozens of input sensors and display options.
In the future, input devices such as tiny attachments to clothes or
eyewear will likely be as common as cell phones. Augmented reality
displays or wearable glasses will integrate what you see with extensive
databases of relevant information.

“Hi,
I’m James, and I’m a technical writer. I’d like to talk
with you about input and output devices … all those devices that
help us to communicate with a computer. I’d also like to talk
about emerging technologies such as virtual reality.”
How do you send instructions and data to the CPU? How do you get
information out? Here we describe one of the most important places where
computers interface with people. We input text, music, and even speech,
but we probably never think about the relationship between what we enter
and what the computer processes. Input devices translate numbers, letters,
special characters, and gestures that people understand into a form that
computers can process.

Have you ever wondered how information processed by the CPU is
converted into a form that you can use? That is the role of output
devices. While input devices convert what we understand into what the
system unit can process, output devices convert what the system unit has
processed into a form that we can understand. Output devices translate
digital information into letters, numbers, sounds, and images that people
can understand.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to know about
the most commonly used input devices, including touch screens, game
controllers, scanners, digital cameras, voice recognition, and audio-input
devices. Additionally, you need to know about the most commonly used
output devices, including monitors, printers, and audio and video output
devices. You also need to be aware of combination input and output devices
such as multifunctional devices, virtual reality devices, drones, and
robots.

What Is Input?
Input is any data or instructions entered into a computer. It
can come directly from you or from other sources. You provide
input whenever you use system or application programs. For
example, when sending a text message from a cell phone, you
enter data in the form of numbers and letters and issue
commands such as send message or attach photo. You also can
enter data and issue commands by pointing to items or using
your voice. Other sources of input include scanned or
photographed images.
Input devices are hardware used to translate words,
numbers, sounds, images, and gestures that people understand
into a form that the system unit can process. For example,
when writing an e-mail, you typically use a keyboard to enter
text and a mouse to issue commands. In addition to keyboards
and mice, there are a wide variety of other input devices.
These include pointing, scanning, image capturing, and audio-
input devices.
Keyboard Entry
When you type into your cell phone or laptop, you are using
one of the most common input devices, a keyboard. As
mentioned in Chapter 5, keyboards convert numbers, letters,
and special characters that people understand into electrical
signals. These signals are sent to, and processed by, the
system unit. Most keyboards use an arrangement of keys given
the name QWERTY. This name reflects the keyboard layout by
taking the letters of the first six alphabetic characters
found on the top row of keys displaying letters.
Keyboards

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
There are a wide variety of keyboard designs, from small cell
phone keyboards designed for short messages to desktop
keyboards designed for longer computing sessions. There are
three basic categories of keyboards: virtual, laptop, and
traditional.
page 137
Virtual keyboards—these keyboards are used primarily with
cell phones and tablets. Unlike other keyboards, virtual
keyboards do not have physical keys. Rather, the keys are
displayed on a screen and selected by touching their image
on the screen. (See Figure 6-1.)
Laptop keyboards—these keyboards are attached to the
laptop system unit and designed to fold up with the laptop
monitor to easily fit in a backpack or briefcase. Many
high-end tablets offer laptop-like features by including a
laptop keyboard that can be removed from the tablet or
double as a protective case for the tablet. Laptop
keyboards come in a variety of configurations, depending on
manufacturer and the size of the laptop. These keyboards
include all the keys found on a typical virtual keyboard,
as well as extra keys, such as function and navigation
keys. (See Figure 6-2.)
Traditional keyboards—these full-size keyboards are
widely used on desktops and larger computers. The standard
U.S. traditional keyboard has 101 keys, including extra
keys, such as a function keys, navigation keys, and a
numeric keypad. Some traditional keyboards include a few
additional special keys. For example, the Windows keyboard
includes a Windows key to directly access the Start menu.
Some keys, such as the Caps Lock key, are toggle keys.
These keys turn a feature on or off. Others, such as the
Ctrl key, are combination keys, which perform an action

Description
tips
Do you wish your virtual keyboard had the feel and sound of a
physical keyboard? Look for these features in your cell phone
or tablet’s settings to give your virtual keyboard a more
physical presence.
1
The sound of a keyboard—Cell phones can mimic the clicking
noise of a physical keyboard by playing a clicking sound when you
type on the virtual keyboard.
On an iOS device, turn on the system setting “Keyboard
Clicks.”
On an Android device, turn on the system setting “Touch
sounds.”
2
The feel of a keyboard—Cell phones can mimic the sense of
pressing a physical key through a technology called haptics.
Haptics are the use of sound and vibration to simulate a physical
sensation.
On an iOS device, turn on the system setting “System
Haptics.”
On an Android device, turn on the system setting “Vibrate on
touch.”

Pointing Devices
Pointing is one of the most natural of all human gestures.
Pointing devices provide an intuitive interface with the
system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures such
as a finger pointing or moving across a screen and converting
these movements into machine-readable input. There are a wide
variety of pointing devices, including the touch screen,
mouse, and game controller.
Touch Screens
A touch screen allows users to select actions or commands by
touching the screen with a finger or stylus. A stylus is a
penlike device typically used with tablets and mobile
devices. (See Figure 6-4.) Often, a stylus interacts with the
computer through handwriting recognition software.
Handwriting recognition software translates handwritten
notes into a form that the system unit can process.

Multitouch screens can be touched with more than one
finger, which allows for interactions such as rotating
graphical objects on the screen with your hand or zooming in
and out by pinching and stretching your fingers. Multitouch

Mice
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the monitor.
The mouse pointer usually appears in the shape of an arrow.
It frequently changes shape, however, depending on the
application. A mouse can have one, two, or more buttons,
which are used to select command options and to control the
mouse pointer on the monitor. Some mice have a wheel button
that can be rotated to scroll through information that is
displayed on the monitor. (See Figure 6-6.)
Figure 6-6 Cordless mouse with wheel button

Traditionally, the detected movements are communicated to
the system unit through a cord. Alternatively, the cordless

communicate with the system unit. These devices eliminate the
mouse cord and free up desk space.
community
While the standard input devices work well for many of us, not everyone
has the same physical or motor control abilities. Engineers and
scientists have developed different pointing devices, keyboards, and
even gamepads to make sure that everyone in our communities can write
e-mails, surf the web, and play video games.
These devices vary. Some are designed to be used without using your
hands; others are controlled by your mouth or eyes. Others make it
easier to use your hands with limited mobility, such as gamepads and
joysticks with large programmable buttons.
Have you used an input device designed for improved accessibility, or
seen one used? How can accessible input devices improve someone’s
quality of life and connection with their community?
Like a mouse, a touch pad is used to control the mouse
pointer and to make selections. Unlike a mouse, however, a
touch pad operates by moving or tapping your finger on the
surface of a pad. These devices are widely used instead of a
mouse with laptops and some types of mobile devices. (See
Figure 6-7.)

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Game controllers are devices that provide input to computer
games. While keyboards and traditional mice can be used as
game controllers, the four most popular and specialized game
controllers are joysticks, gaming mice, gamepads, and motion-
sensing devices. (See Figure 6-8.)
page 139
Joysticks control game actions by users varying the
pressure, speed, and direction of a control stick.
Gaming mice are similar to traditional mice with higher
precision, faster responsiveness, and programmable buttons.
Gamepads are designed to be held by two hands and provide a
wide array of inputs, including motion, turning, stopping,
and firing.
Motion-sensing devices control games by user movements.
For example, Nintendo’s Joy-Con controller accepts user
movements to control games on the Nintendo Switch.

Scanning Devices
Scanning devices convert scanned text and images into a form
that the system unit can process. There are five types of
scanning devices: optical scanners, card readers, bar code
readers, RFID readers, and character and mark recognition
devices.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner, also known simply as a scanner, accepts
documents consisting of text and/or images and converts them
to machine-readable form. These devices do not recognize
individual letters or images. Rather, they recognize light,
dark, and colored areas that make up individual letters or
images. Typically, scanned documents are saved in files that
can be further processed, displayed, printed, or stored for
later use.
privacy
Audio inputs have become incredibly common in our devices. With the
increase in smart devices, it can be easy to overlook all the devices
that listen to us for voice commands. While it is well recognized that
cell phones have microphones, many would be surprised to learn that
smart thermostats and smart refrigerators include microphones. One of
the ways that our devices improve their voice recognition is to always
be listening and recording our conversations and to send these
conversations to researchers and scientists for analysis and study.
Privacy advocates are concerned that people who own smart devices may
not realize they are being recorded and studied. Companies and
researchers point out that for a device to respond to our voice, it
must be listening to us and that privacy settings allow users to
customize how much of their information they want to share. How many
microphones are in your home? Are you concerned about how your
conversations might be used by the devices that listen to you?
reset page 356
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
There are four basic types of optical scanners: flatbed,
document, portable, and 3D.
A flatbed scanner is much like a copy machine. The image to
be scanned is placed on a glass surface, and the scanner
records the image.
A document scanner is similar to a flatbed scanner except
that it can quickly scan multipage documents. It
automatically feeds one page of a document at a time
through a scanning surface. (See Figure 6-9.)
A portable scanner is typically a handheld device that
slides across the image, making direct contact.
3D scanners use lasers, cameras, or robotic arms to record
the shape of an object. Unlike 2D scanners, most 3D
scanners cannot recognize light, dark, and colored page 140
areas. Instead, 3D scanners recognize the shape of
the object they are scanning. (See Figure 6-10.)

Optical scanners are powerful tools for a wide variety of end
users, including graphics and advertising professionals who
scan images and combine them with text.
Card Readers
Nearly everyone uses a credit card, debit card, access
(parking or building) card, and/or some type of
identification card. These cards typically have the user’s
name, some type of identification number, and signature on
the card. Additionally, encoded information is often stored
on the card. Card readers interpret this encoded information.
Although there are several different types, by far the
most common is the magnetic card reader. The encoded
information is stored on a thin magnetic strip located on the
back of the card. When the card is swiped through the
magnetic card reader, the information is read. Many credit
cards, known as chip cards, include additional security in
the form of a microchip embedded in the credit card. This
chip contains encrypted data that makes it nearly impossible
for criminals to forge a duplicate card. Some chips require
that you insert the card into a specialized reader, while
others feature contactless payment, and only require that you
hold the card near the reader. (See Figure 6-11.)

Bar Code Readers
You are probably familiar with bar code readers or scanners
from grocery stores. These devices are either handheld wand
readers or platform scanners. They contain photoelectric
cells that scan or read bar codes, or the vertical zebra-
striped marks printed on product containers. Bar codes can be
found many places, from stickers on fruit to labels on
prescription medicine bottles.
There are a variety of different codes, including UPC and
MaxiCode.
UPCs (Universal Product Codes) are widely used by retail
stores to automate the processes to check out customers, to
change product prices, and to maintain inventory records.
MaxiCode is widely used by the United Parcel Service (UPS)
and others to automate the process of routing packages,
tracking in-transit packages, and locating lost packages.
Cell phones with the appropriate app can also scan codes.
(See Figure 6-12.) For example, after scanning the bar code
from a product you are thinking of buying, the app Price
Check by Amazon will provide in-store and online price
comparisons as well as provide other customer product
reviews.

RFID Readers
RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags are tiny chips
that can be embedded in almost everything. They can be found
in consumer products, driver’s licenses, passports, and any
number of other items. (See Figure 6-13.) These chips contain
electronically stored information that can be read using an
RFID reader located several yards away. They are widely used
to monitor and locate lost pets; to track food from farm to
table; and to record prices, product descriptions, and
locations of retail items.

Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that are
able to recognize special characters and marks. They are
specialty devices that are essential tools for certain
applications. Three types are
Magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR)—used by banks
to automatically read those unusual numbers on the bottom
of checks and deposit slips. A special-purpose machine
known as a reader/sorter reads these numbers and provides
input that allows banks to efficiently maintain customer
account balances.
Optical-character recognition (OCR)—uses special
preprinted characters that can be read by a light source
and changed into machine-readable code. A common OCR device
is the handheld wand reader. (See Figure 6-14.) These are
used in department stores to read retail price tags by
reflecting light on the printed characters.
Optical-mark recognition (OMR)—senses the presence or
absence of a mark, such as a pencil mark. OMR is often used
to score standardized multiple-choice tests.

Image-Capturing Devices
Optical scanners, like traditional copy machines, can make a
copy from an original. For example, an optical scanner can
make a digital copy of a photograph. Image-capturing devices,
on the other hand, create or capture original images. These
devices include digital cameras and webcams.
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras capture images digitally and store the images
on a memory card or in the camera’s memory. Most digital
cameras are also able to record video as well. (See Figure 6-
15.) Originally, digital cameras were only dedicated devices.
Today, many digital cameras are embedded in other devices,

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
such as cell phones and tablets. Digital cameras provide a
fast and easy way to create photos to share over social media
and e-mail.

Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that capture
images and send them to a computer for broadcast over the
Internet. Webcams are built into most cell phones and
tablets. Desktop and laptop webcams are either built in or
attached to the computer’s monitor. (See Figure 6-16.)
Popular videoconferencing apps, such as Zoom, Microsoft
Teams, and Apple’s FaceTime, use webcams to allow you to
communicate in real time with friends and family using live
video.

ethics
You may have heard of instances where webcams were used to broadcast
the activities of individuals who did not know they were being
recorded. For example, in a famous court case, a university student was
prosecuted for using a webcam on an open laptop to secretly record his
roommate’s intimate activities. In other situations, public webcams
have recorded embarrassing footage of people who were not aware of the
camera. It has been argued that capturing and then broadcasting a
person’s image without his or her knowledge and consent is unethical.
What do you think?
Audio-Input Devices
Audio-input devices convert sounds into a form that can be
processed by the system unit. By far the most widely used
audio-input device is the microphone. Audio input can take
many forms, including the human voice and music.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound card,
and special software. These systems allow users to operate

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
computers and other devices, as well as to create documents,
using voice commands. As discussed in Chapter 4, most cell
phones include a virtual assistant that uses voice
recognition to accept voice commands to control operations.
Apple devices come with Siri, Windows devices come with
Cortana, Amazon devices come with Alexa, and Android devices
come with Google Assistant. There are even devices on the
market that exclusively offer access to virtual assistants
with voice recognition, such as Amazon’s Echo, Apple’s
HomePod, and Google’s Home. These voice recognition systems
can perform any number of operations, including scheduling
events on your calendar, composing simple text messages, and
looking up facts on the web. Specialized portable voice
recorders are widely used by doctors, lawyers, and others to
record dictation. These devices are able to record for
several hours before connecting to a computer running voice
recognition software to edit, store, and print the dictated
information. Some systems are even able to translate
dictation from one language to another, such as from English
to Japanese.

What Is Output?
Output is processed data or information. Output typically
takes the form of text, graphics, photos, audio, and/or
video. For example, when you create a presentation using a
presentation graphics program, you typically input text and
graphics. You also could include photographs, voice
narration, and even video. The output would be the completed
presentation.Output
devices are any hardware used to provide or to
create output. They translate information that has been
processed by the system unit into a form that humans can
understand. There are a wide range of output devices. The
most widely used are monitors, printers, and audio-output
devices.
Monitors
The most frequently used output device is the monitor. Also
known as display screens, monitors present visual images of
reset page 366
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
text and graphics. Monitors vary in size, shape, and cost.
Almost all, however, have some basic distinguishing features.
Features
The most important characteristic of a monitor is its
clarity. Clarity refers to the quality and sharpness of the
displayed images. It is a function of several monitor
features, including resolution, dot pitch, contrast ratio,
active display area, and aspect ratio.
Resolution is one of the most important features. Images
are formed on a monitor by a series of dots, or pixels
(picture elements). (See Figure 6-17.) Resolution is
expressed as a grid of these dots or pixels. For example,
many monitors today have a resolution of 1,920 pixel
columns by 1,080 pixel rows for a total of 2,073,600
pixels. The higher a monitor’s resolution (the more
pixels), the clearer the image produced. See Figure 6-18
for the most common monitor resolutions.
Dot (pixel) pitch is the distance between each pixel. The
ideal dot pitch depends on how you use your monitor. Most
newer desktop monitors have a dot pitch below 0.30 mm
(30/100th of a millimeter). Cell phones, which are designed
to be viewed more closely than desktop monitors, can have
dot pitches below 0.05 mm (5/1,000th of a millimeter). The
lower the dot pitch (the shorter the distance between
pixels), the clearer the images.
Contrast ratios indicate a monitor’s ability to display
images. It compares the light intensity of the brightest
white to the darkest black. The higher the ratio, the
better the monitor. Good monitors typically have contrast
ratios above 1,000:1.
Active display area, or size, is measured by the diagonal
length of a monitor’s viewing area. Common sizes are 15,
17, 19, 21, and 24 inches.
reset page 367
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Aspect ratio indicates the proportional relationship
between a display’s width and height. Typically, this
relationship is expressed by two numbers separated by a
colon (:). Many older, more square-shaped monitors have a
4:3 aspect ratio. Almost all newer monitors have a 16:9
aspect ratio designed to display widescreen content.

Another important monitor feature is the ability to accept
touch or gesture input such as finger movements, including
swiping, sliding, and pinching. Although most older monitors
do not support touch input, it is becoming a standard feature
of newer monitors.

tips
Do your photos and videos look different depending on what
screen you use? It may be due to different video settings. TV
and computer monitors come from the factory with standard
settings. To get the best performance from a monitor, you
should calibrate the display.
1
Before you calibrate. Many factors can change a monitor’s
response to calibration. To ensure that you have a proper baseline
before fine-tuning your device, consider these factors before
calibration:
Warm up the TV or monitor. Allow the display to warm up for
half an hour before calibration.
Set the display resolution to its default (or native)
resolution.
Calibrate in a room with ambient light. Direct light on the
screen can make it difficult to accurately assess your
display’s picture quality.
2
Select your picture mode. Found within the display or monitor’s
settings, a picture mode is a collection of preset profiles that
adjusts the display to work well with different types of content.
With categories like cinema, sports, games, and dynamic, these
preset configurations change display settings, including color
temperature, brightness, and contrast, to customize the display to
the viewer’s preference. For true color representation, look for
THX or ISF modes; failing that, use cinema or theater mode.
3
Use software tools. To truly maximize your display for its
surrounding environment, you will need to fine-tune its
calibration. For computer monitors, both Windows and macOS come
with free monitor calibration tools in the control panel or system
preferences of your computer. Many TV manufacturers offer free
setup tools as well—check the manual and software that came with
your TV. Finally, you can purchase calibration tools, such as the
THX Tune-up app from THX.
Flat-Panel Monitors

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used type of monitor
today. Compared to other types, they are thinner, are more
portable, and require less power to operate. (See Figure 6-
19.)
Figure 6-19 Flat-panel monitor

Almost all flat-panel displays are backlit, meaning that a
common source of light is dispersed over all the pixels on
the screen. There are three basic types of flat-panel
monitors: LCD, LED, and OLED.
LCD (liquid crystal display) is widely used for older
monitors and is typically less expensive.
LED (light-emitting diode) monitors use similar technology
with a more advanced backlighting technology. They produce
reset page 370
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
better-quality images, are slimmer, and are more
environmentally friendly as they require less power and use
fewer toxic chemicals to manufacture. Most new monitors are
LED.
OLED (organic light-emitting diode) monitors replace the
LED monitor’s backlighting technology with a thin layer of
organic compound that produces light. By eliminating the
backlight, OLED monitors can be even thinner with better
power efficiency and contrast ratios.

E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books in
electronic format. These books are available from numerous
sources, including many public and private libraries,
bookstore websites, and the cloud. E-book readers (e-
readers) are dedicated mobile devices for storing and
displaying e-books and other electronic media, including
electronic newspapers and magazines.
E-book readers have displays that are typically 6 inches
and use a technology known as e-ink. E-ink produces images
that reflect light like ordinary paper, making the display
easy to read. Two well-known e-book readers are Amazon’s
Kindle and Walmart’s Kobo eReaders (See Figure 6-20.)
Figure 6-20 E-book reader

Tablets can also display e-books. They are larger,
heavier, and more expensive than e-book readers. They are
also much more flexible, with displaying e-books being only
one of their any number of applications. Unlike dedicated e-
book readers, these tablets use LCD displays that provide
crisp, colorful images; however, they are difficult to read
in bright light due to their reflective nature. Two well-

Other Monitors
There are several other types of monitors. Some are used for
more specialized applications, such as making presentations
and watching television.
Digital or interactive whiteboards are specialized devices
with a large display connected to a computer or projector.
The computer’s desktop is displayed on the digital
whiteboard and controlled using a special pen, a finger, or
some other device. Digital whiteboards are widely used in
classrooms and corporate boardrooms. (See Figure 6-21.)
Flexible screens allow digital devices to display images on
nonflat surfaces. Early uses of flexible screens included
cell phones with screens that wrap around the edges of the
phone and curved monitors whose edges wrap toward the
viewer. Recent innovations include foldable screens, such
as the Samsung Galaxy Fold, a cell phone with a screen that
unfolds to become a tablet. (See Figure 6-22.)
Digital projectors project the images from a traditional
monitor onto a screen or wall. This is ideal for
presentations or meetings when several people need to see
the screen at the same time. These projectors can be as
small as a coffee cup and can project images larger than a
standard computer monitor. Unfortunately, projected images
can be difficult to see in bright rooms, so they are best
used in dark rooms with curtains or no windows. (See Figure
6-23.)

Printers
Even as many individuals, schools, and businesses are trying
to go paperless, printers remain one of the most used output
devices. You probably use a printer to print homework
assignments, photographs, and web pages. Printers translate
information that has been processed by the system unit and
present the information on paper.
Features
There are many different types of printers. Almost all,
however, have some basic distinguishing features, including
resolution, color capability, speed, memory, duplex printing,
and connectivity.
Resolution for a printer is similar to monitor resolution.
It is a measure of the clarity of images produced. Printer
resolution, however, is measured in dpi (dots per inch).
(See Figure 6-24.) Most printers designed for personal use
average 1,200 by 4,800 dpi. The higher the dpi, the better
the quality of images produced.
Color capability is provided by most printers today. Users
typically have the option to print either with just black
ink or with color. Because it is more expensive to print in
color, most users select black ink for letters, drafts, and
reset page 375
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
homework. The most common black ink selection is grayscale,
in which images are displayed using many shades of gray.
Color is used more selectively for final reports containing
graphics and for photographs.
Speed is measured in the number of pages printed per
minute. Typically, printers for personal use average 15 to
19 pages per minute for single-color (black) output and 5
to 12 pages per minute for color output.
Memory within a printer is used to store printing
instructions and documents waiting to be printed. The more
memory, the faster it will be able to print large
documents.
Duplex printing allows automatic printing on both sides of
a sheet of paper. Although not currently a standard feature
for all printers, it will likely become standard in the
future as a way to reduce paper waste and to protect the
environment.
Connectivity is the ability of the printer to connect to a
network, eliminating the need for a computer to be attached
by a cable to the printer and making it easier for multiple
computers to share one printer. Many printers include the
ability to connect to a network over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface of
paper. This process produces high-quality images in a variety
of colors, making it ideal for printing photos. (See Figure
6-25.) Inkjet printers are relatively inexpensive and are the
most widely used printers. In addition, they are reliable and
quiet. The most costly aspect of inkjet printers is replacing
the ink cartridges. For this reason, most users specify black
ink for the majority of print jobs and use the more expensive
color printing for select applications. Typical inkjet
printers produce 15 to 19 pages per minute of black-only
output and 5 to 12 pages of color output.

Laser Printers
The laser printer uses a technology similar to that used in a
photocopying machine. Laser printers use a laser light beam
to produce images with excellent letter and graphics quality.
reset page 377
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
More expensive than inkjet printers, laser printers are
faster and are used in applications requiring high-quality
output.
There are two categories of laser printers. Personal laser
printers are less expensive and are used by a single user.
They typically can print 15 to 17 pages a minute. Shared
laser printers typically support color, are more expensive,
and are used (shared) by a group of users. Shared laser
printers typically print over 50 pages a minute.
3D Printers
3D printers, also known as additive manufacturing, create
three-dimensional shapes by adding very thin layer after
layer of material until the final shape is fully formed. (See
Figure 6-26.) A variety of different processes and materials
can be used to create each layer. One of the most common
extrudes a liquid plastic or other substance through a nozzle
similar to an inkjet printer.
Figure 6-26 3D printer
Solcan Design/Shutterstock
3D printers are controlled by data describing the shape of
the object to be created. This data typically comes from a
file created by a 3D modeling program or from scanning a
physical model using a 3D scanner. Specialized programs then
reset page 378
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
take this data and further process it to create data
describing hundreds or thousands of horizontal layers that,
when placed one on top of another, form the shape of the
intended object. The printer uses this data by extruding a
foundation layer to very exact specifications. Successive
layers are then created and attached to the layer below it
until the product is finalized. The layers are so thin and so
precise that they blend together, making a final product that
shows no sign of the individual layers.
Commercial 3D printers have been used for decades. Their
cost, however, limited them to specialized manufacturing and
research applications. For example, auto manufacturer
Volkswagen uses 3D printers in its production lines to
produce gear knobs and custom tailgate lettering. Recently,
the cost of 3D printers has dropped to as low as $200, making
them available to individuals.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers. These include
cloud printers, thermal printers, and plotters:
Cloud printers are printers connected to the Internet that
provide printing services to others on the Internet. Google
Cloud Print is a service that supports cloud printing. Once
a user activates a printer using the Google Chrome OS, the
user can access that printer anywhere with a cell phone or
any other type of computer that is connected to the
Internet. For example, you could use a cell phone from
almost anywhere to send documents to be printed on a
printer located at your home or school.
Thermal printers use heat elements to produce page 148
images on heat-sensitive paper. These printers are
widely used with ATMs and gasoline pumps to print receipts.
Plotters are special-purpose printers for producing a wide
range of specialized output. Using output from graphics
reset page 379
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
tablets and other graphical input devices, plotters create
maps, images, and architectural and engineering drawings.
Plotters are typically used by graphic artists, engineers,
and architects to print out designs, sketches, and
drawings.

Audio-Output Devices
Audio-output devices translate audio information from the
computer into sounds that people can understand. The most
widely used audio-output devices are speakers and
headphones. (See Figure 6-27.) These devices connect to a
sound card within the system unit. This connection can be by
cable to an audio jack on the system unit, or the connection
can be wireless. Wireless connections typically use Bluetooth
technology. This type of connection requires special
Bluetooth-enabled speakers and/or headphones. Bluetooth will
be discussed further in Chapter 8. The sound card is used to
capture as well as play back recorded sounds. Audio-output
devices are used to play music, vocalize translations from
one language to another, and communicate information from the
computer system to users. To learn more about headphones, see
the Making IT Work for You: Headphones on pages 150 and 151.

Creating voice output is not anywhere near as difficult as
recognizing and interpreting voice input. In fact, voice
output is quite common. It is used with many cell phones,
cars, and soft drink machines. It is used as a reinforcement
tool for learning, such as to help students study a foreign
language. It also is used in many supermarkets at the
checkout counter to confirm purchases. One of its most
powerful capabilities is to assist people with disabilities.
Combination Input and Output
Devices
Many devices combine input and output capabilities. Sometimes
this is done to save space. Other times it is done for very
specialized applications. Common combination devices include
headsets, multifunctional devices, virtual reality head-
mounted displays and controllers, drones, and robots.
Headsets

Headsets combine the functionality of microphones and
headphones. The microphone accepts audible input, and
headphones provide audio output. Headsets are an integral
part of multiplayer video game systems. (See Figure 6-28.)

page 149
Multifunctional Devices
Multifunctional devices (MFD) typically combine the
capabilities of a scanner, printer, fax, and copy machine.
These multifunctional devices offer a cost and space
advantage. Compared to purchasing a scanner, printer, fax,
and copy machine individually, the MFD is less expensive and
takes up less space, but the MFD is also more complex and
more like to break down. Further, a device built for a single
purpose (such as a scanner) is more likely to have
professional-level features and perform faster than an MFD.
The output quality for any one function is often not quite as
good as that of the separate single-purpose devices. The
reset page 382
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
reliability of multifunctional devices suffers because
problems with one of the functional parts can make the entire
device inoperable. Even so, multifunctional devices are
widely used in home and small business offices.
Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays and Controllers
Virtual reality (VR) is an artificial, or simulated, reality
created in 3D by computers. It strives to create a virtual or
immersive experience by using specialized hardware that
includes a head-mounted display and controller. (See Figure
6-29.)
Figure 6-29 Virtual reality head-mounted display and
controllers

VR head-mounted displays have earphones for immersive
sound, stereoscopic screens to present 3D images, and
gyroscopic sensors to interpret head orientation.
VR controllers have sensors that collect data about your
hand movements. Coupled with software, this interactive
sensory equipment lets you immerse yourself in a computer-
generated world.
There are any number of applications for virtual reality
head-mounted displays and controllers. Automobile

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
manufacturers use virtual reality to evaluate what it would
be like to sit in the cars they have designed but not yet
built. Recently released virtual reality hardware for gaming
consoles and high-end PCs look to revolutionize the way we
work and play. Virtual reality promises to become commonplace
in the near future.
Drones
Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), were once too
expensive for anything but military budgets. However,
today’s drones are inexpensive, faster, and smarter, making
them a valuable tool and fun high-tech toy. (See Figure 6-
30.) Most drones take input from a controller from either a
radio joystick or a Wi-Fi-connected tablet or laptop. The
drones act as an output device, sending back video and sound
to the user. The resulting combination of video and aerial
maneuverability has made drones a popular choice for a wide
variety of activities ranging from amateur cinematography to
civil engineering. Drone use is on the rise by all types of
users. Drones are used in agriculture to apply pesticides and
monitor livestock, in disaster relief to look for people in
distress, and by the post office to deliver mail.

Making IT work for you
HEADPHONES
For many computer users, headphones have become an
indispensable accessory. From cell phone headsets with
microphones for phone conversations to high-end ergonomic
headphones for extended music listening, there are a lot
of options when choosing the right headphones. Here are
the main features you need to consider when deciding on
what headphones are right for you: style, connection, and
special features.
Style
There are three basic styles of headphones: over-ear, in-ear, and
on-ear.Over-ear
headphones are the largest headphones, with cups that
surround the ear and soft linings to block out external sounds.
The large size of the headphones allows for larger speakers with
greater sound quality. Additionally, the soft linings are
comfortable for long sessions listening to music. However, the
larger size makes them difficult for travel or exercise, and their
ability to block out external noise can cause you to miss
important external sounds, such as an alarm or siren.
Consequently, these headphones are popular with music enthusiasts
and professionals and are primarily used indoors.
In-ear headphones are the smallest of the headphones, with tiny
speakers that insert into the ear canal or rest just outside of
it. These headphones are ideal for travel and exercise as they are
small, are easily packed, and stay in place when walking or
running. However, the smaller size often comes at the cost of
lower sound quality. Like the over-ear headphones, in-ear
headphones block many external sounds—which makes them easier to
reset page 385
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
hear but can be dangerous, especially for pedestrians and people
who exercise outside or near traffic.
On-ear headphones offer a form factor similar to over-ear
headphones, except they do not have a cup that surrounds the ear,
the speaker simply presses against the ear. This allows for more
outside noise to be heard, which (depending on your use) can be
valuable or dangerous. Compared to in-ear headphones, the larger
speakers of on-ear headphones allow for greater volume and sound
quality, at the cost of portability.
Over-ear headphones

page 151
Connection
Traditionally, headphones have wires that transmit music from the
digital device to the headphones, but recently wireless headphones
have become very popular.
Wireless headphones use digital compression techniques to send
music from the digital device to the headphones. This can result
in a loss of audio quality. Wireless headphones also need their
own batteries. For small headphones that fit in the ear, the small
size requires small batteries with shorter battery life.
reset page 386
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Wired in-ear headphones

Although there are many wireless headphone connection
technologies, the most common is Bluetooth, which is compatible
with most laptops, tablets, and cell phones. Finally, wireless
headphones offer the freedom of not being physically connected to
your digital device; however, the wireless connection is not
perfect. There is a limit to how far you can be from the digital
device, and external factors such as walls and other wireless
signals can cause wireless connections to be interrupted or
dropped.
Special Features
Microphones. Although a strict definition of headphones would only
include audio output devices, many manufacturers sell headphones
with microphones. Even though these are more accurately classified
as a headset, you will often find them advertised as headphones
with a microphone. A headset is particularly useful for making
phone calls, contributing to videoconferences, and playing online
video games.
Water resistance. The small, intricate workings of headphones
are particularly susceptible to water damage. If you expect to be
using headphones in a damp environment or you expect to sweat
while using your headphones, you will want headphones that offer
water resistance. Keep in mind that water-resistant is not
waterproof. Water-resistant headphones can handle being splashed
with water but are not designed to be submerged.
Active noise cancellation. Specialized headphones with unique
hardware can listen to external sounds and produce sound waves
that cancel out these external noises. This active noise
cancellation can make a noisy environment sound quiet. This
feature is often expensive and requires batteries. Nonetheless,
active noise cancellation headphones are popular among travelers
who want to drown out jet engines and road noise. Do not confuse
this feature with noise isolation, which is simply blocking out
sound with foam or padding.

Robots
Like drones, robots have become relatively inexpensive with
expanding capabilities. Robots use cameras, microphones, and
other sensors as inputs. Based on these inputs, robotic
outputs can be as complex as exploring damaged nuclear
reactors to as simple as taking a photo. Recent improvements
in robotics software and decreases in hardware prices have
made robots more prevalent in industrial and hobbyist
workshops. Robots can be found almost everywhere, including
vacuuming floors in homes, assembling cars in factories, and
aiding surgeons in hospitals. (See Figure 6-31.)

Ergonomics
People use computers to enrich their personal and private
lives. There are ways, however, that computers can make
people less productive and even harm their health. Anyone who
frequently uses a computer can be affected. As a result,
there has been great interest in a field known as ergonomics.
Ergonomics (pronounced “er-guh-nom-ix”) is defined as
the study of human factors related to things people use. It
is concerned with fitting the task to the user rather than
reset page 389
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
forcing the user to contort to do the task. For computer
users and manufacturers, this means designing input and
output devices to increase ease of use and to avoid health
risks.
Sitting in front of a screen in awkward positions for long
periods may lead to physical problems such as eyestrain,
headaches, and back pain. Computer users can alleviate these
problems by taking frequent rest breaks and by using well-
designed computer furniture. Some recommendations by
ergonomics experts are illustrated in Figure 6-32.
Figure 6-32 Ergonomic recommendations

Description
reset page 390
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Other recommendations to avoid physical discomfort are
Eyestrain and headache: To make the computer easier on the
eyes, take a 15-minute break every hour or two. Keep
everything you’re focusing on at about the same distance.
For example, the computer screen, keyboard, and a document
holder containing your work might be positioned about 20
inches away. Clean the screen of dust from time to time.
Back and neck pain: To help avoid back and neck problems,
make sure your equipment is adjustable. You should be able
to adjust your chair for height and angle, and the chair
should have good back support. The monitor should be at eye
level or slightly below eye level. Use a footrest, if
necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.
Repetitive strain injury: Repetitive strain
page 153
injury (RSI) is any injury that is caused by fast,
repetitive work that can generate neck, wrist, hand, and
arm pain. RSI is by far the greatest cause of workplace
illnesses, resulting in compensation claims totaling
billions of dollars and lost productivity every year. One
particular type of RSI, carpal tunnel syndrome, found
among heavy computer users, consists of damage to nerves
and tendons in the hands. Some victims report the pain is
so intense that they cannot open doors or shake hands and
that they require corrective surgery. Ergonomically correct
keyboards have been developed to help prevent injury from
heavy computer use. (See Figure 6-33.) In addition to using
ergonomic keyboards, you should take frequent short rest
breaks and gently massage your hands.

page 154
Portable Computers
Although these recommendations apply to all personal
computers, the design of portable computers, including cell
phones, tablets, and laptops, presents some specific
ergonomic challenges.
Cell phones: Today, cell phones are more likely to be used
for texting than talking. As a result, thumbs are often
used to type on a tiny keyboard. The result can be a pain
at the base or in the muscles of the thumb or wrist. This
problem can be minimized by keeping wrists straight (not
bent), head up, and shoulders straight and frequently
resting thumbs by using other fingers.
Tablets: Almost all tablets use a virtual keyboard and are
designed to be held in your hands, flat on a table, or
slightly angled. These design features cause the user to
improperly align his or her head to the viewing surface,
often causing neck and back pain. This problem, sometimes
referred to as tablet hunch, can be minimized by taking
frequent breaks, moving around while working, using a
reset page 392
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
tablet cover or stand that allows the screen to be tipped
at various angles, and using an external keyboard.
Laptops: Almost all laptops have attached keyboards and
screens. Unfortunately, it is impossible to optimally
position either for safe ergonomic use. When the screen is
positioned appropriately at eye level, the keyboard is too
high. When the keyboard is appropriately positioned, the
screen is too low. To minimize the negative impact, raise
the level of the screen by using books or reams of paper
under the laptop and attach an external keyboard to be used
at waist level.
By using our devices with our ergonomic needs in mind,
we can reduce stress and strain on the body and ensure
our health and comfort into the future.

Careers in IT
“Now

like to tell you about my career as a technical writer.”
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical
reports, and other scientific or technical documents. Most
technical writers work for computer software firms,

government agencies, or research institutions. They
translate technical information into easily understandable
instructions or summaries. As new technology continues to
develop and expand, the need for technical writers who can
communicate technical expertise to others is expected to
increase.
Technical writing positions typically require an
associate’s or a bachelor’s degree in communications,
journalism, or English and a specialization in, or
familiarity with, a technical field. However, individuals
with strong writing skills sometimes transfer from jobs in
the sciences to positions in technical writing.

Technical writers can expect to earn an annual salary in
the range of $43,000 to $88,000. Advancement opportunities
can be limited within a firm or company, but there are
additional opportunities in consulting.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
reset page 394
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The Internet of Things
As we have discussed, the Internet of Things (IoT) promises many exciting
innovations. Chances are that you are already surrounded by the first wave
of IoT technology. Your cell phone can monitor and share your location,
your smartwatch counts and can share how many steps you took today, and
your web-connected car can track and share your driving habits. Recent
innovations are just the tip of the iceberg as we grapple with a new world
where everything has a sensor and every action is recorded. Where will
these monitoring tools show up next? What information will they record?
How will that information be used?
In the future, most items will likely include a chip that uniquely
identifies that item and shares that data to applications running on the
Internet. Want to know if that Gucci bag is real or a knock-off? Using the
embedded chip in the bag and connecting through Gucci’s phone app, you
will be able to verify that you are buying the genuine article. Were you
just about to throw that delicate cashmere sweater into the washing
machine on the hot cycle? Not to worry, your smart washer/dryer will be
able to read the sweater’s chip and inform you that you could
accidentally shrink your favorite sweater.
Your clothes aren’t the only items that will be marked with a chip.
The food you purchase will also be uniquely identified. Your refrigerator
will be able to read those chips to tell what food you are eating, how
frequently, which foods are in danger of spoiling, and which foods need to
be replenished. Can’t find the mayonnaise? Your fridge will know where it
is and can guide you to it. Running low on milk? Don’t worry—your fridge
will recognize when it is time to buy milk and will add it to your grocery
list.

reset page 395
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
The IoT will extend beyond the home. As you drive to the grocery store
to pick up the milk your refrigerator ordered, cameras on billboards along
the road identify the make and model of your vehicle and tailor their
advertising to your interests. Throughout your shopping trip, cameras are
used to identify your race, gender, and age to highlight products and
information that appeal to your demographic. Your smart grocery cart
accesses your grocery list and guides you around the store, pointing out
sale items and deals. As you pick items up and place them into the cart,
the cart automatically updates your bill. No need to go to the cashier,
just exit the building and your smart grocery cart will charge your credit
card automatically.
Privacy advocates raise concerns related to the IoT. With sensors
recording your location, shopping habits, diet, activity, and even what
you are wearing, companies and governments will have an unprecedented
detailed view of people’s lives. Obviously, this can make shopping
faster, laundry easier, and cooking less hassle, but it can also let
companies know what you eat, what you wear, and how much you spend—
information that you may not want to share. Today, there are concerns
about cell phones and connected televisions having the capabilities to
record your activities in your own home. In the future, as more devices
and products become interconnected, some caution that you may need to
worry about your dinner spying on you and your socks giving away your
secrets!
What do you think? Is the world moments away from Internet-connected
clothing, or is this more science fiction? Are the losses in privacy worth
the gains in convenience?

AZHANA BINTI ZAINUDDIN/Shutterstock
Input is any data or instructions that are used by a
computer. Input devices translate words, numbers,
sounds, images, and gestures that people understand into
a form that the system unit can process. These include
keyboards and pointing, scanning, image capturing, and
audio-input devices.
Keyboards convert numbers, letters, and special
characters that people understand into electrical
signals. These signals are sent to, and processed by, the
system unit.
Keyboards
There are three basic categories of keyboards: virtual,
laptop, and traditional.
Virtual keyboards are primarily used with cell phones
and tablets. Does not have a physical keyboard. Keys
displayed on screen and selected by touching a key’s
image.
Laptop keyboards are used on laptop computers. Smaller
than traditional keyboard with fewer keys. Includes all
the keys found on virtual keyboard plus extra keys,
such as function and navigation keys.

Traditional keyboards are used on desktop and larger
computers. Standard keyboard has 101 keys. Toggle keys
turn features on and off. Combination keys perform
actions when combinations of keys are held down.
POINTING DEVICES

Pointing devices provide an intuitive interface with the
system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures
and converting them into machine-readable input.
Touch Screens
Touch screens allow users to select actions by touching
the screen with a finger or penlike device. A stylus is
a penlike device that uses pressure to draw images on a
screen. Handwriting recognition software translates
handwritten notes into a form that the system unit can
process. Multitouch screens accept multiple-finger
commands.
Mouse
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the
monitor. The mouse pointer usually appears in the shape
reset page 398
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
of an arrow. Some mice have a wheel button that rotates
to scroll through information on the monitor. A cordless
or wireless mouse uses radio waves or infrared light
waves. A touch pad operates by touching or tapping a
surface. It is widely used instead of a mouse with
laptops and some types of mobile devices.
Game Controllers
Game controllers provide input to computer games. Widely
used controllers include gaming mice, joysticks,
gamepads, and motion-sensing devices.
page 157
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need
to be aware of the most commonly used input and output
devices. These devices are translators for information
into and out of the system unit. Input devices
translate words, sounds, and actions into symbols the
system unit can process. Output devices translate
symbols from the system unit into words, images, and
sounds that people can understand.
SCANNING DEVICES

Scanning devices move across text and images to convert
them into a form that the system unit can process.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner (scanner) converts documents into
machine-readable form. The four basic types are flatbed,
document, portable, and 3D.
Card Readers
Card readers interpret encoded information located on a
variety of cards. The most common is the magnetic card
reader that reads information from a thin magnetic strip
on the back of a card. Chip cards contain microchips to
encrypt data and improve security.
Bar Code Readers
Bar code readers or scanners (either handheld wand
readers or platform scanners) read bar codes on
products. There are a variety of different codes,
including the UPC and MaxiCode.
RFID Readers
reset page 400
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
RFID readers read RFID (radio-frequency identification)
tags. These tags are widely used for tracking lost pets,
production, and inventory and for recording prices and
product descriptions.
Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that
are able to recognize special characters and marks. Three
types are magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR),
optical-character recognition (OCR), and optical-mark
recognition (OMR).
IMAGE-CAPTURING DEVICES
Stefano Garau/Shutterstock
Image-capturing devices create or capture original
images. These devices include digital cameras and
webcams.
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras record images digitally and store them
on a memory card or in the camera’s memory. Most digital
cameras record video too. Today, many digital cameras are

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
embedded in other devices, such as cell phones and
tablets.
Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that
capture images and send them to a computer for broadcast
over the Internet. Webcams are built into many cell
phones and tablets, while others are attached to the
computer monitor.
AUDIO-INPUT DEVICES
Audio-input devices convert sounds into a form that can
be processed by the system unit. By far the most widely
used audio-input device is the microphone.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound
card, and special software. Siri, Cortana, and Google
Assistant are digital assistants that use voice
recognition. Specialized portable voice recorders are
widely used by doctors, lawyers, and others to record
dictation. Some systems are able to translate dictation
from one language to another, such as from English to
Japanese.

Output is processed data or information. Output devices
are hardware used to provide or create output. Monitors
(display screens) are the most-used output device.
Features
Monitor clarity is a function of resolution (matrix of
pixels, or picture elements), dot pitch, contrast
ratio, active display area, and aspect ratio.
Flat-Panel Monitors
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used monitor.
Three basic types are LCD (liquid crystal display), LED
(light-emitting diode), and OLED (organic light-
emitting diode).
E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books
in electronic format. E-book readers (e-readers) store
and display e-books and other electronic media. They use
e-ink technology.
Other Monitors

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Other types of monitors include:
Digital (interactive) whiteboards are specialized
devices with a large display connected to a computer or
projector.
Flexible screens allow digital devices to display
images on nonflat surfaces.
Digital projectors project the images from a
traditional monitor onto a screen or wall.
PRINTERS
Science Photo Library/Alamy Stock Photo
Printers translate information processed by the system
unit and present the information on paper.
Features
Basic features include resolution measured in dpi (dots
per inch), color capability (most common black ink
selection is grayscale), speed, memory, duplex (both
sides of paper) printing, and connectivity.
Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface
of paper. They are the most widely used type of printer,
reset page 404
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
reliable, quiet, and inexpensive. The most costly aspect
of inkjet printers is replacing the ink cartridges.
Laser Printers
Laser printers use technology similar to a photocopying
machine. There are two categories: personal and shared.
3D Printers
3D printers (additive manufacturing) create objects by
adding layers of material onto one another. They have
been available for decades; however, recent price
reductions have increased their popularity.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers, including
cloud printers (Google Cloud Print is a cloud printing
service), thermal printers (use heat elements to produce
images on heat-sensitive paper), and plotters (use data
from graphics tablets and other graphical devices).

Audio-output devices translate audio information from the
computer into sounds that people can understand. The most
widely used are speakers and headphones. These devices
connect either by cable to an audio jack on the system
unit or by a wireless connection. Bluetooth technology
is widely used to connect wireless devices.
COMBINATION INPUT AND OUTPUT DEVICES
Combination devices combine input and output
capabilities. Devices within this category include:
Headsets combine the functionality of microphones and
headphones; integral part of serious video game
systems.
Multifunctional devices (MFDs) typically combine
capabilities of scanner, printer, fax, and copy
machine.
Virtual reality (VR) creates 3D-simulated immersive
experiences. VR hardware includes head-mounted
displays and controllers.

Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs) take input
from a controller and send output video and sound to
the user.
Robots use cameras, microphones, and other sensors as
inputs; outputs can be as complex as exploring damaged
nuclear reactors to as simple as taking a photo.
ERGONOMICS
Dmitriy Melnikov/123RF
Ergonomics is the study of human factors related to
things people use.
Recommendations
Some recommendations to avoid physical discomfort
associated with heavy computer use:
To avoid eyestrain and headache, take a 15-minute break
every hour, keep everything you’re focusing on at the
same distance, and clean the screen periodically.
To avoid back and neck pain, use adjustable equipment;
adjust chairs for height, angle, and back support;
position monitors at eye level or slightly below. Use a
footrest, if necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.
To avoid repetitive strain injury (RSI) and carpal
tunnel syndrome, use ergonomically correct keyboards;
take frequent, short rest breaks; and gently massage
hands.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Portable Computers
The design of portable computers presents ergonomic
challenges.
Laptops do not allow correct positioning of keyboard
and screen; raise level of laptop and use external
keyboard.
Tablets with virtual keyboards cause improper alignment
of user’s head; take frequent breaks, move while
working, use cover or stand, use external keyboard.
Cell phones require extensive use of thumbs; keep
wrists straight, head up, and shoulders straight and
use other fingers.
CAREERS in IT
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical
reports, and other documents. An associate’s or a
bachelor’s degree in communication, journalism, or
English and a specialization in, or familiarity with, a
technical field are required. Expected salary range is
$43,000 to $88,000.
