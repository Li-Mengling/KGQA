Not long ago, trained specialists were required to manually perform many
of the operations you can now do with a computer. Market analysts used
calculators to project sales. Graphic artists created designs by hand.
Data processing clerks created electronic files to be stored on large
computers. Now you can do all these tasks—and many others—with a
personal computer and the appropriate application software.
Think of the personal computer as an electronic tool. You may not
consider yourself very good at typing, calculating, organizing,
presenting, or managing information. However, a personal computer can help
you do all these things and much more. All it takes is the right kinds of
software.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand
the capabilities of general-purpose application software, which includes
word processors, spreadsheets, presentation programs, and database
management systems. You also need to know about integrated packages and
software suites.
Application Software
As we discussed in Chapter 1, there are two kinds of
software. System software works with end users, application
software, and computer hardware to handle the majority of
technical details. Application software can be described as
end-user software and is used to accomplish a variety of
tasks.
Application software can be divided into three categories.
One of the most popular categories, mobile apps, consist of
applications designed for cell phones and tablets. Another
category, general-purpose applications, includes word
processing programs, presentation software, spreadsheets, and
database management systems. Finally, specialized
applications include thousands of programs that are more
narrowly focused on specific disciplines and occupations.
App Stores
reset page 179
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
An app store is where you can download applications to work
with your mobile, laptop, and desktop devices. Some
applications are free, but many cost a nominal fee. Three of
the best-known app stores are Apple’s App Store, Google
Play, and the Microsoft Store (See Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1 Apple’s App Store

Applications are written for a particular type of device.
For example, an app designed for Apple’s iPhone will not
work on a Windows laptop. Therefore, most app stores focus on
apps for a particular type of device. For example, the
Microsoft Store focuses on apps for Windows laptops and
desktops, while the Apple App Store has apps designed to work
on Apple devices. For a list of some of the more widely used
app stores, see Figure 3-2.

User Interface
A user interface is the portion of the application that
allows you to control and to interact with the program.
Depending on the application, you can use a mouse, a
keyboard, a stylus, a finger, and/or your voice to
communicate with the application. Most general-purpose
applications use a mouse and a graphical user interface
(GUI) that displays graphical elements called icons to
represent familiar objects. The mouse controls a page 59
pointer on the screen that is used to select items
such as icons. Another feature is the use of windows to
display information. A window is simply a rectangular area
that can contain a document, program, or message. (Do not
confuse the term window with the various versions of
Microsoft’s Windows operating systems, which are programs.)
More than one window can be opened and displayed on the
computer screen at one time.
The standard GUI uses a system of menus, toolbars, and
dialog boxes. (See Figure 3-3.)
Menus present commands that are typically displayed in a
menu bar at the top of the screen.
Toolbars typically appear below the menu bar and include
small graphic elements called buttons that provide
shortcuts for quick access to commonly used commands.
Dialog boxes provide additional information and request
user input.

Figure 3-3 Traditional graphical user interface
Microsoft Corporation
Description
Many applications, and Microsoft applications in
particular, use an interface known as the Ribbon GUI, which
changes based on the needs of the user. This GUI uses a
system of interrelated ribbons, tabs, and galleries. (See
Figure 3-4.)
Ribbons replace toolbars and menus by organizing commonly
used commands into sets of related activities. These
activities are displayed as tabs and appear in the first
ribbon.
Tabs divide the ribbon into major activity areas. page 60
Each tab is then organized into groups that contain
related items. Some tabs, called contextual tabs, appear
only when they are needed and anticipate the next operation
to be performed by the user.

Common Features
Most applications provide a variety of features to make
entering/presenting, editing, and formatting documents easy.
Some of the most common features include
Spelling and grammar checker—looks for misspelled words or
grammatical errors.
Alignment—centers, right-aligns, or left-aligns numbers
and characters.

Fonts and font sizes—specify the size and style of entered
numbers and text.
Character effects—provide a variety of different
typefaces, such as bold or italics.
Edit options—provide easy ways to edit text, such as cut,
copy, and paste.
Find and replace—searches a document for a specific word
or phrase, with the option to replace the word or phrase
with something else.

Fake Reviews
Shopping apps help customers make smart purchases by posting
consumers’ reviews of products. For example, Amazon allows its
community of users to rate products from one to five stars. You can
even search for products based on the product’s average star rating.
Unfortunately, these ratings can also be faked; there are entire
companies that offer services to post fake reviews and falsely improve
a product’s ratings. Some feel that Amazon should be held responsible
for making sure its star rankings are truthful, while others suggest it
is the company’s responsibility. Do you trust online reviews? Should
companies be held accountable for the reviews posted on its site, or is
it a case of “buyer beware”?

Mobile Apps
Mobile apps or mobile applications are add-on programs for a
variety of mobile devices, including cell phones and tablets.
Sometimes referred to simply as apps, mobile apps have been
widely used for years. The traditional applications include
address books, to-do lists, alarms, and message lists. With
the introduction of cell phones, tablets, and wireless
connections to the Internet, mobile capabilities are almost
limitless. See Figure 3-5 for a list of some of the most
widely used mobile apps.

Apps
The breadth and scope of available mobile applications for
cell phones and other mobile devices are ever expanding.
There are over 3.5 million mobile apps on the Google Play
store alone. Some of the most widely used are for listening
to music, viewing video, social networking, shopping, and
game playing.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Music apps stream music, organize playlists, and recommend
new artists. The Spotify app offers free music with ads.
For a monthly fee, apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music
offer ad-free listening, offline listening, and other extra
features.
Video apps are a favorite way to watch movie trailers and
video blogs. The YouTube app offers access to free online
videos such as movie trailers and video blogs. The Netflix
app provides access to more professional videos for a fee.
Social networking apps let you use your mobile device to
share vacation photos, check in at your favorite coffee
shop, or invite friends to a party. The most widely used
social media app is Facebook, but other apps, such as
Instagram and TikTok, are gaining in popularity.
Shopping apps make shopping online quick and easy. These
apps will help you find products, read customer reviews,
and make purchases.
Gaming apps are an enjoyable way to pass the time page 62
on a cell phone. Some game apps cost money, but
others work on a free-to-play model, where the initial game
is free, but the more advanced features require an in-app
purchase. Games vary from Crossy-road, a simple arcade-
style game, to Stardew Valley, a complex role-playing game
(RPG) where gamers create a farm, grow crops, and raise
livestock. (See Figure 3-6.)

privacy
Although mobile apps on your cell phone are an amazing way to share
your life with friends and family on social media, it is easy to forget
that these apps are constantly recording your location, photos you
take, and local businesses that you visit. Privacy advocates are
concerned that this data might be used for unintended purposes. For
example, employers could access and use this information when deciding
who to hire. In fact, such cases are documented. Employers argue that
they should consider every aspect of a future or current employee,
including how an employee’s media presence could reflect on the
company. What do you think?
Many apps are written for a particular type of mobile
device and will not run on other types. For example, an app
designed for Apple’s iPhone may not work with Google’s
Android.

General-Purpose Applications
As mentioned previously, general-purpose applications include
word processors, spreadsheets, presentation software, and
database management systems.
Word Processors
Word processors create text-based documents and are one of
the most flexible and widely used software tools. All types
of people and organizations use word processors to create
memos, letters, and reports. Organizations create
newsletters, manuals, and brochures to provide information to
their customers. Students and researchers use word processors
to create reports.
Microsoft Word is the most widely used word processor.
Other popular word processors include Apple Pages and Google
Docs.
Assume that you have accepted a job as an advertising
coordinator for Adventure Travel Tours, a travel agency
specializing in active adventure vacations. Your primary
responsibilities are to create and coordinate the company’s
promotional materials, including flyers and travel reports.

You have been asked to create a promotional advertising flyer. After
discussing the flyer’s content and basic structure with your supervisor,
you start to enter the flyer’s text. As you enter the text, the spell
checker and grammar checker catch some spelling and grammatical errors.
Once the text has been entered, you proofread the text and then focus
your attention on enhancing the visual aspects of the flyer. You add a
photograph and experiment with different character and paragraph formats,
including fonts, font sizes, colors, and alignments.

Creating a Report
Your next assignment is to create a report on Tanzania and Peru. After
conducting your research, you start writing your paper. As you enter the
text for the report, you notice that the AutoCorrect feature
automatically corrects some grammar and punctuation errors. Your report
includes several figures and tables. You use the captions feature to keep
track of figure and table numbers, to enter the caption text, and to
position the captions. You use the footnote feature to assist in adding
notes to further explain or comment on information in the report.
Finally, you prepare the report for printing by adding header and
footer information.

Presentation Software
Presentation software are programs that combine a variety of
visual objects to create attractive, visually interesting
presentations. They are excellent tools to communicate a
message and to persuade people.
People in a variety of settings and situations use
presentation software programs to make their presentations.
For example, marketing managers use presentation software to
present proposed marketing strategies to their superiors.
Salespeople use these programs to demonstrate products and
encourage customers to make purchases. Students use
presentation software to create high-quality class
presentations.
Three of the most widely used presentation software
programs are Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, and Google
Slides.
Assume that you have volunteered for the Animal Rescue
Foundation, a local animal rescue agency. You have been asked

of the foundation to determine the content of the presentation. Then,
using PowerPoint, you begin creating the presentation by selecting a
presentation template and document theme. After entering the content, you
add interest to the presentation by adding animation to selected objects
and using slide transition effects.

Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets organize, analyze, and graph numeric data such
as budgets and financial reports. Once used exclusively by
accountants, spreadsheets are widely used by nearly every
profession. Marketing professionals analyze sales trends.
Financial analysts evaluate and graph stock market trends.
Students and teachers record grades and calculate grade point
averages.
The most widely used spreadsheet program is Microsoft
Excel. Other spreadsheet applications include Apple Numbers
and Google Sheets.

Database Management Systems
A database is a collection of related data. It is the
electronic equivalent of a file cabinet. A database
management system (DBMS) or database manager is a program
that sets up, or structures, a database. It also provides
tools to enter, edit, and retrieve data from the database.
All kinds of individuals use databases, from hospital
administrators recording patient information to police

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
officers checking criminal histories. Colleges and
universities use databases to keep records on their students,
instructors, and courses. Organizations of all types maintain
employee databases.
Three widely used database management systems designed for
personal computers are Microsoft Access, Apple FileMaker, and
Oracle Database Express Edition.

Specialized Applications
While general-purpose applications are widely used in nearly
every profession, specialized applications are widely used
within specific professions. These programs include graphics
programs and web authoring programs.
Graphics Programs
Graphics programs are widely used by professionals in the
graphic arts profession. They use video editors, image
reset page 198
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
editing programs, illustration programs, and desktop
publishing programs.
Video editors are used to edit videos to enhance quality
and appearance of the videos you capture using your cell
phone or other devices. You can readily add special
effects, music tracks, titles, and on-screen graphics.
Just a few years ago, video editors were used only by
professionals with expensive specialized hardware and
software. Now, there are several free or inexpensive
editors designed to assist the amateur videographer. Three
well-known video editors are Movavi Video Editor Plus for
Android phones and tablets, Apple iMovie for apple devices,
and Adobe Premier Elements 2021 for a professional tool on
laptops and desktops. (See Figure 3-13.)
Image editors, also known as photo editors, are page 70
specialized graphics programs for editing or
modifying digital photographs. They are often used to touch
up photographs to remove scratches and other imperfections.
The photographs consist of thousands of dots, or pixels,
that form images, often referred to as bitmap or raster
images. One limitation of bitmap images, however, is that
when they are expanded, the images can become pixelated, or
jagged on the edges. For example, when the letter A in
Figure 3-14 is expanded, the borders of the letter appear
jagged, as indicated by the expanded view.
For cell phones and tablets, Snapseed is a popular image
editor. Most laptops and desktops come with a free photo
editor; the two most common are Microsoft Photo and
Apple’s Photos. Finally, for professional photographers,
Adobe Photoshop is the gold standard in image editors.
Illustration programs, also known as drawing programs, are
used to create and edit vector images. While bitmap images
use pixels to represent images, vector images, also known
as vector illustrations, use geometric shapes or objects.
reset page 199
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
These objects are created by connecting lines and curves,
avoiding the pixeleted or ragged edges created by bitmap
images. (See Figure 3-15.) Because these objects can be
defined by mathematical equations, they can be rapidly and
easily resized, colored, textured, and manipulated. An
image is a combination of several objects.
Illustration programs are often used for graphic design,
page layout, and creating sharp artistic images. Popular
illustration programs include Procreate, Adobe Illustrator
Draw, and Autodesk Sketchbook.
Desktop publishing programs, or page layout programs,
allow you to mix text and graphics to create publications
of professional quality. While word processors focus on
creating text and have the ability to combine text and
graphics, desktop publishers focus on page design and
layout and provide greater flexibility. Professional
graphic artists use desktop publishing programs to create
documents such as brochures, newsletters, newspapers, and
textbooks.
Popular desktop publishing programs include Adobe
InDesign, Microsoft Publisher, and QuarkXPress. These
programs provide the capability to create text and
graphics; however, typically graphic artists import these
elements from other sources, including word processors,
digital cameras, scanners, image editors, illustration
programs, and image galleries.

ethics
Image editing software has made it easy to alter any photo or video to
correct for a variety of different imperfections. However, some
professionals can use these programs to significantly manipulate the
content or meaning of a photo or video. Such changes are often intended
to influence the opinions or emotions of the viewer. Supporters argue
that this type of editing is acceptable and is just another way to
express an opinion or feeling from an editor. Critics note that this
type of image and video manipulation is unethical because it
intentionally misleads the viewer and often creates unobtainable or
unhealthy definitions of beauty. What do you think?

Video game design software will help you organize your
thoughts and guide you through the game design process,
including character development and environmental design.
There are many choices from free software to very expensive
software designed for professional game designers. The video

tips
Do you take photos with your cell phone? Almost everyone does.
Here are some suggestions to keep in mind.
1
Quickly launch the camera app. Sometimes a photo opportunity
comes along and you don’t have time to log into your cell phone.
Did you know that you can quickly access your cell phone’s camera
without logging in?
For Android cell phones: Double-click the power button.
For iOS cell phones: Tap the screen to wake up your phone, then
swipe left.
2
Compose your shot. Your cell phone camera can help you line up or
balance your photos by displaying gridlines on the screen.
For Android cell phones: Open the camera app, open settings,
and turn on the Assistive Grid option.
For iOS cell phones: Click on the settings icon from the home
screen, then select Camera. Finally, turn on the Grid option.
Web Authoring Programs
There are over a billion websites on the Internet, and more
are being added every day. Corporations use the web to reach
new customers and to promote their products. Individuals
create online diaries or commentaries, called blogs. Creating
a site is called web authoring.
Almost all websites consist of interrelated web pages. As
we mentioned in Chapter 2, web pages are typically HTML
(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (cascading style sheets)
documents. With knowledge of HTML and a simple text editor,
you can create web pages. Even without knowledge of HTML, you
can create simple web pages using a word processing package
like Microsoft Word.
More specialized and powerful programs, called web
authoring programs, are typically used to create
sophisticated commercial sites. Also known as web page
reset page 204
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
editors and HTML editors, these programs provide support for
website design and HTML coding. Some web authoring programs
are WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, which
means you can build a page without interacting directly with
HTML code. WYSIWYG editors preview the page described by HTML
code. Widely used web authoring programs include Adobe
Dreamweaver and Froala 4.0.
page 72
Other Specialized Applications
There are numerous other specialized applications, including
accounting, personal finance, and project management
applications. Accounting applications such as Intuit
QuickBooks help companies record and report their financial
operations. Personal financial applications such as Quicken
Starter Edition help individuals track their personal
finances and investments. Project management software like
Microsoft Project is widely used in business to help
coordinate and plan complicated projects.

Software Suites
A software suite is a collection of separate application
programs bundled together and made available as a group. Four
types of suites are office suites, cloud suites, specialized
suites, and utility suites.
reset page 205
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Office Suites
Office suites, also known as office software suites and
productivity suites, contain general-purpose application
programs that are typically used in a business situation.
Productivity suites commonly include a word processor,
spreadsheet, database manager, and a presentation
application. The best known is Microsoft Office. Another
well-known productivity suite is Apple iWork.
Cloud Computing
Cloud suites or online office suites are stored at a server
on the Internet and are available anywhere you can access the
Internet. Documents created using cloud applications can also
be stored online, making it easy to share and collaborate on
documents with others. One downside to cloud applications is
that you are dependent on the server providing the
application to be available whenever you need it. For this
reason, when using cloud applications, it is important to
have backup copies of your documents on your computer and to
have a desktop office application available to use. Popular
cloud office suites include Google Workspace Microsoft 365
and Apple iWorks. (See Figure 3-17.) To learn more about
cloud office suites, see Making IT Work for You: Cloud Office
Suites on pages 74 and 75.

AJR_photo/Shutterstock
Software engineers analyze users’ needs and create
application software. Software engineers typically have
experience in programming but focus on the design and
development of programs using the principles of mathematics
and engineering.
A bachelor’s or an advanced specialized associate’s
degree in computer science or information systems and an
extensive knowledge of computers and technology are
required by most employers. Internships may provide
students with the kinds of experience employers look for in
a software engineer. Those with specific experience with
web applications may have an advantage over other
applicants. Employers typically look for software engineers
with good communication and analytical skills.
Software engineers can expect to earn an annual salary
in the range of $63,000 to $148,000. Starting salary is
dependent on both experience and the type of software being
developed. Experienced software engineers are candidates
for many other advanced careers in IT.

CLOUD OFFICE SUITES
Do you work with a team on documents, presentations, or
spreadsheets? Do your teammates use different computers
and work in different locations? Do you sometimes need to
work remotely—from home, a hotel, or in a coffee shop?
Remote team work is growing in popularity, and cloud
office suites can give you the tools to succeed.
Choosing a Cloud Office Suite The three biggest cloud office suites
are Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Apple’s iWork. Each is unique,
with different prices, strengths, and weaknesses. Here are a few things
to consider when choosing a cloud office suite for your team:
What does your team use now? To use a cloud office suite, everyone
in your team will need to sign up online and set up their devices.
This can be time-consuming, but if you are already using one of these
tools, the work may already be done. For example, if your team
currently uses Google Docs, setting up a collaborative workspace could
be as simple as sending an e-mail.
How experienced are your teammates? A team knowledgable in
Microsoft Office can produce impressive, customized results quickly
and professionally. However, the time and training necessary to become
an expert in Microsoft Office may be too much for teammates with
little or no computer experience. Other collaborative office suites,
such as Apple iWorks and Google Workspace, are recognized as being
easier for new users.
When choosing a cloud office suite, consider the experience and
knowledge of your teammates to make the best choice for your team.
Each cloud suite offers different online storage options and price
points. To learn more about pricing and options, check out these

Collaborating with Your Group Online collaborative office suite tools
share many important features:
reset page 211
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Document versions—When changes are made to a document by members of
the team, the collaborative tools create a new version of the
document. This feature allows team members to explore changes in the
document without fear of losing important work.
Member changes—when a team member changes a document, the
collaborative tool tells the group about the change by highlighting
the change and identifying who made it. Use this tool to track
members’ impact on the document and to quickly see what changes have
been made.
Adding members to the team—As the document progresses, you may
want to get more opinions. Collaborative tools let you add new people
to your team, but also limit what they can do. Some team members may
be able to view and edit the document, whereas others may only be able
to view it. This is a good tool to show someone your work without
concern that they might accidentally edit something.
Most collaborative cloud office suites, like Google Workspace, offer the
ability to see who made changes to a document and when and to undo those
changes if necessary.
Google, INC.
Mobile Tools For many, working at a laptop or desktop computer is the
easiest way to compose a document or presentation. However, when
traveling on a crowded plane or walking down the hallway with a
classmate, you can use cloud office suites on your tablet or phone. This
is a great way to review a document, make a small comment, or quickly
show a document to a teacher or friend. Apple, Google, and Microsoft all
have apps to download to cell phones and tablets that allow you to view
your online documents and make simple changes with interfaces designed
for the smaller screens and touch interfaces of tablets and cell phones.

Many office suites, like Apple’s iWorks, are designed to work with
mobile devices and offline utility suites, such as Apple’s word
processor, Pages, which has apps for computers, laptops, and cell phones.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The New Workplace Realities
Working from home has become increasingly popular. Many no longer commute
to work but, instead, have a home office or work from the kitchen table.
However, working from home is lacking in important features that office
buildings provided. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
technologies offer a future where you still work from home but experience
all the benefits of working at the office. The future office building may
be located in virtual reality, and the next meeting you have may be a
blend of physical and virtual elements that make up augmented reality.
reset page 213
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Augmented reality glasses and complex camera arrays are looking to
vastly change the way in which we videoconference. Imagine a meeting
between yourself in L.A. and a co-worker in London. You both enter
specialized rooms with multiple cameras that capture your position and
appearance. You both wear augmented reality eyeglasses. In London, your
co-worker sits down at a table. AR software records her position and
appearance in London and sends that information to you in L.A. Your AR
software projects the appearance and position of your co-worker onto the
transparent AR glasses. Although you can see the room around you, the
image of your co-worker is overlaid on your vision of the room to give the
appearance that she is in the room as well.

As the meeting progresses, you present your ideas to your co-worker
through charts and graphs. These charts float around the room in virtual
screens. You decide to bring in a third member to the meeting. Your co-
workers in the office outside the augmented reality meeting room are using
virtual reality headsets, doing their work in virtual offices. You ask
your manager to join you, and the manager joins the meeting by changing
his virtual location to the meeting room. Because the VR headset covers
your manager’s face, he appears in the room as an avatar, a virtual
representation of your manager.
Virtual reality office spaces have the potential to completely remove
the need for office space. Workers could use VR software at home and
complete their work with co-workers in a virtual office. Augmented reality
programs could allow you to try on clothes without going to the store,

overlaying a projection of an outfit to model the style and fit of a
garment. Although not common yet, these tools are currently being
developed by researchers and scientists.
Soon the glasses themselves may be unnecessary. Developments in
flexible and translucent screens may one day be so compact that your AR
glasses could be AR contact lenses. Scientists at UC Berkley are working
on a power supply that is the size of a grain of rice and transmits power
through ultrasonic pulses—allowing energy to pass through the body and be
absorbed by the power supply. In this future, a computer screen will
always be at your disposal, with hand gestures and head position monitored
to create virtual keyboards that only you can see. Would you enjoy working
at a virtual desk and attending virtual meetings, or do you think that
virtual work would be less productive?
