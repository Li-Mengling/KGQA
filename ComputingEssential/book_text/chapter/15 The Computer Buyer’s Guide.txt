The Computer Buyer’s Guide
PART 1: WHICH TYPES OF COMPUTERS SHOULD
YOU PURCHASE?
Many individuals feel confused and overwhelmed when it comes
to buying a new computer. In today’s market, there are
various categories of computers ranging from desktops and
laptops to ultraportable tablets and smartphones. And within

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
each category, there are countless choices and a wide range
of prices. This buying guide will help you choose the best
combination of computers for your needs, as well as point out
some key specifications that they should have.
LAPTOP COMPUTERS: TODAY’S STANDARD
Typical Recommendation: Buy a $700 to $1,000 laptop
with a 13-inch screen.
The laptop computer has become the must-have device that can
do everything you need, wherever you need it. They are
powerful enough to be your primary home computer (replacing
desktops) while portable enough to take to school, work, the
local coffee shop, and even on your next trip. Many students
are bringing them to classes to take notes and perform
research. If you can own only one computer, make it a laptop.
Affordable ones start at under $700.
If you have decided that you want to buy a laptop
computer, be sure to read Part 2 for additional tips and
recommendations.
SMARTPHONES: COMPUTERS IN YOUR POCKET
Typical Recommendation: Obtain a free or low-cost
smartphone by signing a two-year wireless contract
with a data plan.
For many individuals, the smartphone has become much like a
wallet, purse, or keys—you don’t leave home without it.
This single pocket-sized device fills many roles. It is a
mobile phone, digital camera, video recorder, gaming device,
and personal digital assistant. Most individuals purchase a
smartphone because they need to access information quickly
and easily, regardless of where they are.
With many smartphones now available for free with two-year
contracts, it is easier than ever to replace your older cell

phone. The biggest drawback to owning a smartphone is that
its “use anywhere” benefit is limited if it is not paired
with a wireless data plan, which can often cost around $30
per month.
Although Apple’s iPhone was once the clear leader in the
smartphone market, various Android devices include
competitive features and are enjoying favorable reviews. If
you have decided that you want to buy a smartphone, be sure
to read Part 2 for additional tips and recommendations.
TABLETS: THE RISING STARS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a 10-inch tablet with 64
GB of storage.
The release of the iPad has revived this category of
computers. With an attractive, 10-inch touch-screen surface,
it has quickly become a popular device for watching videos,
playing games, reading e-books, and browsing the web. Tablets
are light enough to hold comfortably for many hours, yet
powerful enough to use a variety of apps. They generally have
a much longer battery life than laptop computers.
If you are a typical computer user, then you may not
benefit much from purchasing a tablet computer. Most of your
computing time will be spent on your laptop computer (at home
and at school, for example) or on your smartphone. Although
tablets are very popular right now, you must remember that
they cost several hundred dollars. You should have a very
clear need for this sort of device before you decide to spend
the money on it.
Many students consider buying tablets because the low
weight makes a tablet easy to carry around. Although this is
true, there are lightweight laptop computers that weigh only
one or two pounds more and are much more versatile than
tablets. Such versatility is crucial for various types of
software that are not available as apps and require
reset page 827
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
installation on a Windows or Mac computer. Before you decide
between a tablet and lightweight laptop, consider the type of
software you will need for your schoolwork, business, or
personal use. If everything you need is available page 359
as a mobile app, then a tablet (paired with a
wireless keyboard) will be more affordable than a lightweight
laptop computer.
In conclusion, purchase a tablet computer only if you see
yourself using it often. The touch-screen interface, low
weight, and long battery life do indeed make it easy to carry
around and use almost anywhere you go. However, the price tag
does not make the decision an obvious one if you already own
a laptop computer and smartphone. If you have decided that
you want to buy a tablet, be sure to read Part 2 for
additional tips and recommendations.
DESKTOPS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a tower system with a
20- to 24-inch monitor for approximately $900.
Desktop (or tower) computers have been around for a long
time. You will still find them in many offices and homes.
However, they are steadily losing popularity because laptop
computers have become very powerful and affordable. Why have
a computer that remains stuck in your home or office when you
can have a laptop that can be taken almost anywhere?
Although laptop computers seem to be the better choice,
there are several reasons why you might want to purchase a
desktop computer. First, the use of a laptop computer as your
primary computer can be uncomfortable. After prolonged use,
it can place stress on your neck, back, and wrists. Desktops
typically come with large monitors, and various types of
ergonomic keyboards are available. However, desktop critics
will point out that laptop computers can be connected to
reset page 828
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
external monitors and keyboards as well. The only downside is
that a laptop requires the purchase of extra equipment.
The other reason to get a desktop is if you have a
specific need that cannot be addressed by a laptop computer.
For example, some families have a media center computer that
holds all the videos, photos, and music for the entire home
network. Another example involves gamers, who often seek to
build or customize extremely powerful computers. They often
choose desktops for this endeavor.
Most users will not need to purchase a desktop computer.
In fact, they are currently the least popular of the four
categories in this buying guide. However, if you have decided
that you want to buy a desktop, be sure to read Part 2 for
additional tips and recommendations.
PART 2: PERSONALIZED BUYING GUIDE
Now that you have decided which types of computers you need,
it is time to explore computer specifications. The following
areas explore the decision-making process from the
perspective of various buyers.
LAPTOPS
There are two basic categories of laptops: the traditional
laptop and the ultrabook. Although these two categories of
laptop computers have the same general appearance, they vary
greatly in power, storage capacity, weight, and battery life.
The following section helps you find the device that best
meets your needs.
User #1: I am a power user. I need a portable computer that
can handle the latest video games or process-intensive
operations such as video editing, engineering, and design.
reset page 829
-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Response #1: Purchase a traditional laptop computer that
includes the following minimum specs:
The fastest categories of processors with large number of
cores and high GHz count
A graphics processor (GPU) outside of the main CPU
16-GB RAM
1-TB hard drive
17-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $1,500, perhaps more. For games,
many individuals choose Windows-based PCs. The video and
design industries usually use Macs.
User #2: I am a regular user. I need a desktop replacement
and portable computer. I typically run office software, use
the Internet, and listen to music.
Response #2: Purchase an affordable traditional laptop
computer that includes the following specs:
Middle-tier processors—not the fastest but not the
slowest either
8-GB RAM
500-GB hard drive
15-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $800 to $1,000. For maximum
savings, as well as compatibility with most software, many
buyers choose Windows-based PCs. Be sure to purchase an
external monitor, keyboard, and mouse if you plan on heavy
use while at home.

User #3: I want a small, lightweight computer that I can
carry anywhere. I would like long battery life for extended
use.
Response #3: Purchase an ultrabook with
11- to 13-inch screen
Solid-state hard drive
8-GB RAM
Weight under 4 pounds
Expect to pay $700 to $1,000. Many ultrabooks will not
include a DVD drive. Windows-based ultrabooks tend to be more
affordable. The MacBook Air is slightly more page 360
expensive, but it has always been considered a
leader in the lightweight laptop field.
SMARTPHONES
Shopping for a smartphone involves three separate processes:
(1) choosing an operating system, either iOS or Android; (2)
choosing a device; and (3) choosing a wireless carrier.
Although the following section does not review different
wireless companies or data plans, it presents a list of
smartphone features that you should always consider before
making your choice. In addition, it presents each smartphone
operating system from the perspective of typical users.
Features to Consider
Screen and device size: Consider a size (and weight) that
is comfortable for you to use and carry around. Four-inch
screens are now typical.
Screen resolution: Some devices deliver HD quality for
sharp photos and videos.

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Integrated keyboard: Consider one if you type often on
these devices.
Storage: Having 64 GB is enough for most users. Choose
128 GB or more if you plan to store large quantities of
music, photos, and videos. Some devices allow you to
increase storage by using memory cards.
Battery life: About 7 to 8 hours is typical. Some devices
have removable batteries.
Cameras: Many include front- and rear-facing cameras.
Compare megapixels and photo quality.
App market: Consider the number of apps, and ensure that
any apps you need are available for this operating
system.
Operating Systems
iOS: The iPhone is considered by many to be the standard
against which all smartphones are measured. Buyers
typically choose the iPhone if they are Mac owners or
prefer a tightly controlled “ecosystem” from Apple
where stability and ease of use are favored over heavy
customization.
Android: There are many Android devices available from
various manufacturers, some free with a wireless
contract. Buyers who enjoy customizing their interface
typically choose Android. In addition, this operating
system is tightly integrated with many of Google’s
products and services.
Remember that smartphones can cost very little when you sign
a two-year contract with a wireless company. Consider whether
you want to make that sort of commitment.
TABLET COMPUTERS

-------------------------------------------- 分页分隔 --------------------------------------------
Because of their increased popularity, tablets are available
in several sizes from many different companies. The following
section helps you find the device that best meets your needs.
User #1: I want to watch videos, play games, create notes,
and browse websites.
Response #1: Purchase a 10-inch tablet. Expect to pay $400
to $500. Most weigh about 1.5 pounds. Apple’s iPad was very
popular when first released, and it continues to be a popular
choice among buyers today. Other things to consider:
For greater customization, consider an Android-based
tablet. Several models are comparable to the iPad, which
is considered by many reviewers to be the standard
bearer.
The Microsoft Surface tablet includes a keyboard that is
integrated into the cover. However, any tablet can be
paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, which is crucial if you
plan to type often.
Make sure the apps you plan on using are available for
the tablet’s operating system.
Having 16 GB of storage is typical. Some tablets let you
expand this by using flash memory cards.
User #2: I want to read e-books, browse websites, and have a
lightweight device that I can hold with one hand.
Response #2: Purchase a 7-inch tablet. Expect to pay around
$200. Most weigh less than 1 pound. Google’s Nexus 7 and
Amazon’s Kindle Fire are popular Android-based tablets.
